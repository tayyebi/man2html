<pre>E4CRYPT(8)                                            System Manager's Manual                                            E4CRYPT(8)

NAME
       e4crypt - ext4 file system encryption utility

SYNOPSIS
       e4crypt add_key -S [ -k keyring ] [-v] [-q] [ -p pad ] [ path ... ]
       e4crypt new_session
       e4crypt get_policy path ...
       e4crypt set_policy [ -p pad ] policy path ...

DESCRIPTION
       e4crypt performs encryption management for ext4 file systems.

COMMANDS
       e4crypt add_key [-vq] [-S salt ] [-k keyring ] [ -p pad ] [ path ... ]
              Prompts  the  user  for  a passphrase and inserts it into the specified keyring.  If no keyring is specified, e4crypt
              will use the session keyring if it exists or the user session keyring if it does not.

              The salt argument is interpreted in a number of different ways, depending on how its prefix value.  If the first  two
              characters are "s:", then the rest of the argument will be used as an text string and used as the salt value.  If the
              first two characters are "0x", then the rest of the argument will be parsed as a hex string as used as the salt.   If
              the  first  characters  are  "f:" then the rest of the argument will be interpreted as a filename from which the salt
              value will be read.  If the string begins with a '/' character, it will similarly be treated as  filename.   Finally,
              if the salt argument can be parsed as a valid UUID, then the UUID value will be used as a salt value.

              The keyring argument specifies the keyring to which the key should be added.

              The  pad  value  specifies  the number of bytes of padding will be added to directory names for obfuscation purposes.
              Valid pad values are 4, 8, 16, and 32.

              If one or more directory paths are specified, e4crypt will try to set the policy of those directories to use the  key
              just added by the add_key command.  If a salt was explicitly specified, then it will be used to derive the encryption
              key of those directories.  Otherwise a directory-specific default salt will be used.

       e4crypt get_policy path ...
              Print the policy for the directories specified on the command line.

       e4crypt new_session
              Give the invoking process (typically a shell) a new session keyring, discarding its old session keyring.

       e4crypt set_policy [ -p pad ] policy path ...
              Sets the policy for the directories specified on the command line.  All directories must be empty to set the  policy;
              if  the directory already has a policy established, e4crypt will validate that the policy matches what was specified.
              A policy is an encryption key identifier consisting of 16 hexadecimal characters.
