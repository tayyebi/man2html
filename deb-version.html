NAME
       deb-version - Debian package version number format

SYNOPSIS
       [epoch:]upstream-version[-debian-revision]

DESCRIPTION
       Version numbers as used for Debian binary and source packages consist of three components. These are:

       epoch
           This is a single (generally small) unsigned integer.  It may be omitted, in which case zero is assumed.  If it is
           omitted then the upstream-version may not contain any colons.

           It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions of a package, and also a package's previous
           version numbering schemes, to be left behind.

       upstream-version
           This is the main part of the version number.  It is usually the version number of the original (“upstream”) package from
           which the .deb file has been made, if this is applicable.  Usually this will be in the same format as that specified by
           the upstream author(s); however, it may need to be reformatted to fit into the package management system's format and
           comparison scheme.

           The comparison behavior of the package management system with respect to the upstream-version is described below. The
           upstream-version portion of the version number is mandatory.

           The upstream-version may contain only alphanumerics (“A-Za-z0-9”) and the characters . + - : ~ (full stop, plus, hyphen,
           colon, tilde) and should start with a digit.  If there is no debian-revision then hyphens are not allowed; if there is
           no epoch then colons are not allowed.

       debian-revision
           This part of the version number specifies the version of the Debian package based on the upstream version.  It may
           contain only alphanumerics and the characters + . ~ (plus, full stop, tilde) and is compared in the same way as the
           upstream-version is.

           It is optional; if it isn't present then the upstream-version may not contain a hyphen.  This format represents the case
           where a piece of software was written specifically to be turned into a Debian package, and so there is only one
           “debianization” of it and therefore no revision indication is required.

           It is conventional to restart the debian-revision at ‘1’ each time the upstream-version is increased.

           Dpkg will break the version number apart at the last hyphen in the string (if there is one) to determine the upstream-
           version and debian-revision. The absence of a debian-revision compares earlier than the presence of one (but note that
           the debian-revision is the least significant part of the version number).

   Sorting algorithm
       The upstream-version and debian-revision parts are compared by the package management system using the same algorithm:

       The strings are compared from left to right.

       First the initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-digit characters is determined.  These two parts (one of
       which may be empty) are compared lexically.  If a difference is found it is returned.  The lexical comparison is a
       comparison of ASCII values modified so that all the letters sort earlier than all the non-letters and so that a tilde sorts
       before anything, even the end of a part.  For example, the following parts are in sorted order: ‘~~’, ‘~~a’, ‘~’, the empty
       part, ‘a’.

       Then the initial part of the remainder of each string which consists entirely of digit characters is determined.  The
       numerical values of these two parts are compared, and any difference found is returned as the result of the comparison.  For
       these purposes an empty string (which can only occur at the end of one or both version strings being compared) counts as
       zero.

       These two steps (comparing and removing initial non-digit strings and initial digit strings) are repeated until a difference
       is found or both strings are exhausted.

       Note that the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind mistakes in version numbering, and to cope with situations
       where the version numbering scheme changes.  It is not intended to cope with version numbers containing strings of letters
       which the package management system cannot interpret (such as ‘ALPHA’ or ‘pre-’), or with silly orderings.

NOTES
       The tilde character and its special sorting properties were introduced in dpkg 1.10 and some parts of the dpkg build scripts
       only gained support for it later in the 1.10.x series.
