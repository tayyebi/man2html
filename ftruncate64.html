<pre>truncate(2)                                             System Calls Manual                                             truncate(2)

NAME
       truncate, ftruncate - truncate a file to a specified length

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int truncate(const char *path, off_t length);
       int ftruncate(int fd, off_t length);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       truncate():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500
               || /* Since glibc 2.12: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200809L
               || /* glibc &lt;= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE

       ftruncate():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 500
               || /* Since glibc 2.3.5: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L
               || /* glibc &lt;= 2.19: */ _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  truncate() and ftruncate() functions cause the regular file named by path or referenced by fd to be truncated to a size
       of precisely length bytes.

       If the file previously was larger than this size, the extra data is lost.  If the file previously was  shorter,  it  is  ex‐
       tended, and the extended part reads as null bytes ('\0').

       The file offset is not changed.

       If  the size changed, then the st_ctime and st_mtime fields (respectively, time of last status change and time of last modi‐
       fication; see inode(7)) for the file are updated, and the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits may be cleared.

       With ftruncate(), the file must be open for writing; with truncate(), the file must be writable.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       For truncate():

       EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or the named file is not writable by the user.   (See
              also path_resolution(7).)

       EFAULT The argument path points outside the process's allocated address space.

       EFBIG  The argument length is larger than the maximum file size. (XSI)

       EINTR  While blocked waiting to complete, the call was interrupted by a signal handler; see fcntl(2) and signal(7).

       EINVAL The argument length is negative or larger than the maximum file size.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred updating the inode.

       EISDIR The named file is a directory.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire pathname exceeded 1023 characters.

       ENOENT The named file does not exist.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EPERM  The underlying filesystem does not support extending a file beyond its current size.

       EPERM  The operation was prevented by a file seal; see fcntl(2).

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only filesystem.

       ETXTBSY
              The file is an executable file that is being executed.

       For  ftruncate()  the  same  errors apply, but instead of things that can be wrong with path, we now have things that can be
       wrong with the file descriptor, fd:

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EBADF or EINVAL
              fd is not open for writing.

       EINVAL fd does not reference a regular file or a POSIX shared memory object.

       EINVAL or EBADF
              The file descriptor fd is not open for writing.  POSIX permits, and portable applications should handle, either error
              for this case.  (Linux produces EINVAL.)

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD, SVr4 (these calls first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       ftruncate() can also be used to set the size of a POSIX shared memory object; see shm_open(3).

       The  details in DESCRIPTION are for XSI-compliant systems.  For non-XSI-compliant systems, the POSIX standard allows two be‐
       haviors for ftruncate() when length exceeds the file length (note that truncate() is not specified at all in such  an  envi‐
       ronment):  either returning an error, or extending the file.  Like most UNIX implementations, Linux follows the XSI require‐
       ment when dealing with native filesystems.  However, some nonnative filesystems do not permit truncate() and ftruncate()  to
       be used to extend a file beyond its current length: a notable example on Linux is VFAT.

       The  original  Linux  truncate() and ftruncate() system calls were not designed to handle large file offsets.  Consequently,
       Linux 2.4 added truncate64() and ftruncate64() system calls that handle large files.  However, these details can be  ignored
       by applications using glibc, whose wrapper functions transparently employ the more recent system calls where they are avail‐
       able.

       On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for these system calls differ, for the reasons described in syscall(2).

BUGS
       A header file bug in glibc 2.12 meant that the minimum value of _POSIX_C_SOURCE required to expose the declaration of ftrun‐
       cate() was 200809L instead of 200112L.  This has been fixed in later glibc versions.
