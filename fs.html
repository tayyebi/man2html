<pre>filesystems(5)                                          File Formats Manual                                          filesystems(5)

NAME
       filesystems  -  Linux  filesystem  types:  ext,  ext2,  ext3, ext4, hpfs, iso9660, JFS, minix, msdos, ncpfs nfs, ntfs, proc,
       Reiserfs, smb, sysv, umsdos, vfat, XFS, xiafs

DESCRIPTION
       When, as is customary, the proc filesystem is mounted on /proc, you can find in the file /proc/filesystems which filesystems
       your  kernel  currently  supports;  see  proc(5)  for  more  details.   There  is  also a legacy sysfs(2) system call (whose
       availability is controlled by the CONFIG_SYSFS_SYSCALL kernel build configuration option  since  Linux  3.15)  that  enables
       enumeration of the currently available filesystem types regardless of /proc availability and/or sanity.

       If you need a currently unsupported filesystem, insert the corresponding kernel module or recompile the kernel.

       In order to use a filesystem, you have to mount it; see mount(2) and mount(8).

       The  following list provides a short description of the available or historically available filesystems in the Linux kernel.
       See the kernel documentation for a comprehensive description of all options and limitations.

       ext       is an elaborate extension of the minix filesystem.  It has been completely superseded by the second version of the
                 extended filesystem (ext2) and has been removed from the kernel (in Linux 2.1.21).

       ext2      is  a  disk  filesystem  that  was  used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media.  The second extended
                 filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended filesystem (ext).  See ext2(5).

       ext3      is a journaling version of the ext2 filesystem.  It is easy to switch back and forth between ext2 and  ext3.   See
                 ext3(5).

       ext4      is  a set of upgrades to ext3 including substantial performance and reliability enhancements, plus large increases
                 in volume, file, and directory size limits.  See ext4(5).

       hpfs      is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2.  This filesystem is read-only under Linux due  to  the  lack  of
                 available documentation.

       iso9660   is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard.

                 High Sierra
                        Linux  supports  High  Sierra,  the  precursor  to  the  ISO  9660  standard for CD-ROM filesystems.  It is
                        automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux.

                 Rock Ridge
                        Linux also supports the System Use Sharing  Protocol  records  specified  by  the  Rock  Ridge  Interchange
                        Protocol.   They  are  used  to  further  describe  the files in the iso9660 filesystem to a UNIX host, and
                        provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.  It  is  automatically
                        recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux.

       JFS       is a journaling filesystem, developed by IBM, that was integrated into Linux 2.4.24.

       minix     is  the  filesystem  used  in  the  Minix  operating  system,  the  first  to run under Linux.  It has a number of
                 shortcomings, including a 64 MB partition size limit, short filenames, and a single timestamp.  It remains  useful
                 for floppies and RAM disks.

       msdos     is  the  filesystem  used  by  DOS,  Windows,  and  some  OS/2 computers.  msdos filenames can be no longer than 8
                 characters, followed by an optional period and 3 character extension.

       ncpfs     is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare.  It was removed from the kernel in
                 Linux 4.17.

                 To use ncpfs, you need special programs, which can be found at ⟨ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs⟩.

       nfs       is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers.

       ntfs      is  the  filesystem  native to Microsoft Windows NT, supporting features like ACLs, journaling, encryption, and so
                 on.

       proc      is a pseudo filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and  interpret‐
                 ing /dev/kmem.  In particular, its files do not take disk space.  See proc(5).

       Reiserfs  is a journaling filesystem, designed by Hans Reiser, that was integrated into Linux 2.4.1.

       smb       is  a  network  filesystem  that  supports  the  SMB  protocol, used by Windows.  See ⟨https://www.samba.org/samba
                 /smbfs/⟩.

       sysv      is an implementation of the System V/Coherent filesystem for Linux.  It implements all of Xenix FS,  System  V/386
                 FS, and Coherent FS.

       umsdos    is  an  extended DOS filesystem used by Linux.  It adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions,
                 and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without  sacrificing  compatibility  with
                 DOS.

       tmpfs     is  a filesystem whose contents reside in virtual memory.  Since the files on such filesystems typically reside in
                 RAM, file access is extremely fast.  See tmpfs(5).

       vfat      is an extended FAT filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.  vfat adds the capability  to  use  long
                 filenames under the MSDOS filesystem.

       XFS       is a journaling filesystem, developed by SGI, that was integrated into Linux 2.4.20.

       xiafs     was  designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code.  It provides
                 the basic most requested features without undue complexity.  The xiafs filesystem is no longer actively  developed
                 or maintained.  It was removed from the kernel in Linux 2.1.21.
