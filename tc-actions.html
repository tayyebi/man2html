NAME
       actions - independently defined actions in tc

SYNOPSIS
       tc [ TC_OPTIONS ] actions add | change | replace ACTSPEC

       tc [ TC_OPTIONS ] actions get | delete ACTISPEC

       tc [ TC_OPTIONS ] actions flush ACTNAMESPEC

       tc [ TC_OPTIONS ] actions ls | list ACTNAMESPEC [ ACTFILTER ]

               ACTSPEC := action ACTDETAIL [ INDEXSPEC ] [ COOKIESPEC ] [ FLAGS ] [ HWSTATSSPEC ] [ CONTROL ] [ SKIPSPEC ]

               ACTISPEC := ACTNAMESPEC INDEXSPEC

               ACTNAMESPEC := action ACTNAME

               INDEXSPEC := index INDEX

               ACTFILTER := since MSTIME

               COOKIESPEC := cookie COOKIE

               FLAGS := no_percpu

               HWSTATSSPEC := hw_stats { immediate | delayed | disabled }

               ACTDETAIL := ACTNAME ACTPARAMS

               ACTNAME may be any valid action type: gact, mirred, bpf, connmark, csum, police, etc.

               MSTIME Time since last update.

               CONTROL := { reclassify | pipe | drop | continue | ok }

               SKIPSPEC := { skip_sw | skip_hw }

               TC_OPTIONS  These are the options that are specific to tc and not only the options. Refer to tc(8) for more informa‐
               tion.

DESCRIPTION
       The actions object in tc allows a user to define actions independently of a classifier (filter). These actions can  then  be
       assigned to one or more filters, with any packets matching the classifier's criteria having that action performed on them.

       Each action type (mirred, police, etc.) will have its own table to store all created actions.

OPERATIONS
       add    Create a new action in that action's table.

       change
       replace
              Make modifications to an existing action.

       get    Display  the  action  with the specified index value. When combined with the -s option for tc, display the statistics
              for that action.

       delete Delete the action with the specified index value. If the action is already associated with a classifier, it does  not
              delete the classifier.

       ls
       list   List  all the actions in the specified table. When combined with the -s option for tc, display the statistics for all
              actions in the specified table.  When combined with the option since allows doing a millisecond time-filter since the
              last time an action was used in the datapath.

       flush  Delete all actions stored in the specified table.

ACTION OPTIONS
       Note that these options are available to all action types.

       index INDEX
              Specify  the  table  index value of an action.  INDEX is a 32-bit value that is unique to the specific type of action
              referenced.

              For add, change, and replace operations, the index is optional.  When adding a new action, specifying an index  value
              will  assign the action to that index unless that index value has already been assigned. Omitting the index value for
              an add operation will cause the kernel to assign a value to the new action.

              For get and delete operations, the index is required to identify the specific action to be displayed or deleted.

       cookie COOKIE
              In addition to the specific action, mark the matching packet with the value specified by COOKIE.   The  COOKIE  is  a
              128-bit  value that will not be interpreted by the kernel whatsoever.  As such, it can be used as a correlating value
              for maintaining user state.  The value to be stored is completely arbitrary and does not require a  specific  format.
              It is stored inside the action structure itself.

       FLAGS  Action-specific  flags.  Currently,  the  only supported flag is no_percpu which indicates that action is expected to
              have minimal software data-path traffic and doesn't need to allocate stat counters with percpu allocator.   This  op‐
              tion is intended to be used by hardware-offloaded actions.

       hw_stats HW_STATS
              Specifies  the  type  of HW stats of new action. If omitted, any stats counter type is going to be used, according to
              driver and its resources.  The HW_STATS indicates the type. Any of the following are valid:

              immediate
                     Means that in dump, user gets the current HW stats state from the device queried at the dump time.

              delayed
                     Means that in dump, user gets HW stats that might be out of date for some time, maybe couple of seconds.  This
                     is the case when driver polls stats updates periodically or when it gets async stats update from the device.

              disabled
                     No HW stats are going to be available in dump.

       since MSTIME
              When dumping large number of actions, a millisecond time-filter can be specified MSTIME.  The MSTIME is a millisecond
              count since last time a packet hit the action.  As an example specifying "since 20000" implies to  dump  all  actions
              that  have  seen  packets in the last 20 seconds. This option is useful when the kernel has a large number of actions
              and you are only interested in recently used actions.

       CONTROL
              The CONTROL indicates how tc should proceed after executing the action. Any of the following are valid:

              reclassify
                     Restart the classifiction by jumping back to the first filter attached to the action's parent.

              pipe   Continue with the next action. This is the default control.

              drop   Drop the packed without running any further actions.

              continue
                     Continue the classification with the next filter.

              pass   Return to the calling qdisc for packet processing, and end classification of this packet.

       SKIPSPEC
              The SKIPSPEC indicates how tc should proceed when executing the action. Any of the following are valid:

              skip_sw
                     Do not process action by software. If hardware has no offload support for this action, operation will fail.

              skip_hw
                     Do not process action by hardware.
