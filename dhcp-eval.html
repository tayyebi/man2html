NAME
       dhcp-eval - ISC DHCP conditional evaluation

DESCRIPTION
       The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client and server both provide the ability to perform conditional behavior depending on
       the contents of packets they receive.  The syntax for specifying this conditional behaviour is documented here.

REFERENCE: CONDITIONAL BEHAVIOUR
       Conditional behaviour may be  specified using the if statement and the else or elsif  statements  or  the  switch  and  case
       statements.   A  conditional  statement can appear anywhere that a regular statement (e.g., an option statement) can appear,
       and can enclose one or more such statements.

       CONDITIONAL BEHAVIOUR: IF

       A typical conditional if statement in a server might be:

       if option dhcp-user-class = "accounting" {
         max-lease-time 17600;
         option domain-name "accounting.example.org";
         option domain-name-servers ns1.accounting.example.org,
                           ns2.accounting.example.org;
       } elsif option dhcp-user-class = "sales" {
         max-lease-time 17600;
         option domain-name "sales.example.org";
         option domain-name-servers ns1.sales.example.org,
                           ns2.sales.example.org;
       } elsif option dhcp-user-class = "engineering" {
         max-lease-time 17600;
         option domain-name "engineering.example.org";
         option domain-name-servers ns1.engineering.example.org,
                           ns2.engineering.example.org;
       } else {
         max-lease-time 600;
         option domain-name "misc.example.org";
         option domain-name-servers ns1.misc.example.org,
                           ns2.misc.example.org;
       }

       On the client side, an example of conditional evaluation might be:

       # example.org filters DNS at its firewall, so we have to use their DNS
       # servers when we connect to their network.  If we are not at
       # example.org, prefer our own DNS server.
       if not option domain-name = "example.org" {
         prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
       }

       The if statement and the elsif continuation statement both take boolean expressions as their arguments.  That is, they  take
       expressions  that,  when  evaluated, produce a boolean result.  If the expression evaluates to true, then the statements en‐
       closed in braces following the if statement are executed, and all subsequent elsif and else clauses are skipped.  Otherwise,
       each subsequent elsif clause's expression is checked, until an elsif clause is encountered whose test evaluates to true.  If
       such a clause is found, the statements in braces following it are executed, and then any subsequent elsif and  else  clauses
       are  skipped.   If all the if and elsif clauses are checked but none of their expressions evaluate true, then if there is an
       else clause, the statements enclosed in braces following the else are evaluated.  Boolean expressions that evaluate to  null
       are treated as false in conditionals.

       CONDITIONAL BEHAVIOUR: SWITCH

       The above example can be rewritten using a switch construct as well.

       switch (option dhcp-user-class) {
         case "accounting":
           max-lease-time 17600;
           option domain-name "accounting.example.org";
           option domain-name-servers ns1.accounting.example.org,
                             ns2.accounting.example.org;
         case "sales":
           max-lease-time 17600;
           option domain-name "sales.example.org";
           option domain-name-servers ns1.sales.example.org,
                             ns2.sales.example.org;
           break;
         case "engineering":
           max-lease-time 17600;
           option domain-name "engineering.example.org";
           option domain-name-servers ns1.engineering.example.org,
                             ns2.engineering.example.org;
           break;
         default:
           max-lease-time 600;
           option domain-name "misc.example.org";
           option domain-name-servers ns1.misc.example.org,
                             ns2.misc.example.org;
           break;
       }

       The switch statement and the case statements can both be data expressions or numeric expressions.  Within a switch statement
       they all must be the same type.  The server evaluates the expression from the switch statement and then it evaluates the ex‐
       pressions from the case statements until it finds a match.

       If  it  finds  a  match  it starts executing statements from that case until the next break statement.  If it doesn't find a
       match it starts from the default statement and again proceeds to the next break statement.  If there is no match and no  de‐
       fault it does nothing.

BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS
       The following is the current list of boolean expressions that are supported by the DHCP distribution.

       data-expression-1 = data-expression-2

         The  =  operator  compares the values of two data expressions, returning true if they are the same, false if they are not.
         If either the left-hand side or the right-hand side are null, the result is also null.

       data-expression-1 ~= data-expression-2 data-expression-1 ~~ data-expression-2

         The ~= and ~~ operators (not available on all systems) perform extended regex(7) matching of the values of  two  data  ex‐
         pressions,  returning  true if data-expression-1 matches against the regular expression evaluated by data-expression-2, or
         false if it does not match or encounters some error.  If either the left-hand side or the  right-hand  side  are  null  or
         empty strings, the result is also false.  The ~~ operator differs from the ~= operator in that it is case-insensitive.

       boolean-expression-1 and boolean-expression-2

         The  and  operator  evaluates  to  true  if the boolean expression on the left-hand side and the boolean expression on the
         right-hand side both evaluate to true.  Otherwise, it evaluates to false.  If either the expression on the left-hand  side
         or the expression on the right-hand side are null, the result is null.

       boolean-expression-1 or boolean-expression-2

         The  or operator evaluates to true if either the boolean expression on the left-hand side or the boolean expression on the
         right-hand side evaluate to true.  Otherwise, it evaluates to false.  If either the expression on the  left-hand  side  or
         the expression on the right-hand side are null, the result is null.

       not boolean-expression

         The not operator evaluates to true if boolean-expression evaluates to false, and returns false if boolean-expression eval‐
         uates to true.  If boolean-expression evaluates to null, the result is also null.

       exists option-name

         The exists expression returns true if the specified option exists in the incoming DHCP packet being processed.
       known

         The known expression returns true if the client whose request is currently being processed is known - that is, if  there's
         a host declaration for it.
       static

         The  static  expression returns true if the lease assigned to the client whose request is currently being processed is de‐
         rived from a static address assignment.

DATA EXPRESSIONS
       Several of the boolean expressions above depend on the results of evaluating data expressions.  A list of these  expressions
       is provided here.

       substring (data-expr, offset, length)

         The  substring  operator  evaluates  the  data  expression and returns the substring of the result of that evaluation that
         starts offset bytes from the beginning, continuing for length bytes.  Offset and length are both numeric expressions.   If
         data-expr,  offset  or  length  evaluate to null, then the result is also null.  If offset is greater than or equal to the
         length of the evaluated data, then a zero-length data string is returned.  If length is greater then the remaining  length
         of the evaluated data after offset, then a data string containing all data from offset to the end of the evaluated data is
         returned.

       suffix (data-expr, length)

         The suffix operator evaluates data-expr and returns the last length bytes of the result of that evaluation.  Length  is  a
         numeric expression.  If data-expr or length evaluate to null, then the result is also null.  If suffix evaluates to a num‐
         ber greater than the length of the evaluated data, then the evaluated data is returned.

       lcase (data-expr)

         The lcase function returns the result of evaluating data-expr converted to lower case.  If data-expr  evaluates  to  null,
         then the result is also null.

       ucase (data-expr)

         The  ucase  function  returns the result of evaluating data-expr converted to upper case.  If data-expr evaluates to null,
         then the result is also null.

       option option-name

         The option operator returns the contents of the specified option in the packet to which the server is responding.

       config-option option-name

         The config-option operator returns the value for the specified option that the DHCP client or server has  been  configured
         to send.

       gethostname()

         The  gethostname()  function  returns a data string whose contents are a character string, the results of calling gethost‐
         name() on the local system with a size limit of 255 bytes (not including NULL terminator).  This can be used  for  example
         to configure dhclient to send the local hostname without knowing the local hostname at the time dhclient.conf is written.

       hardware

         The hardware operator returns a data string whose first element is the type of network interface indicated in packet being
         considered, and whose subsequent elements are client's link-layer address.  If there is no packet, or if the RFC2131  hlen
         field  is  invalid, then the result is null.  Hardware types include ethernet (1), token-ring (6), and fddi (8).  Hardware
         types are specified by the IETF, and details on how the type numbers are defined can be found in RFC2131 (in the ISC  DHCP
         distribution, this is included in the doc/ subdirectory).

       packet (offset, length)

         The  packet  operator returns the specified portion of the packet being considered, or null in contexts where no packet is
         being considered.  Offset and length are applied to the contents packet as in the substring operator.

       string

         A string, enclosed in quotes, may be specified as a data expression, and returns the text between the quotes,  encoded  in
         ASCII.   The  backslash ('\') character is treated specially, as in C programming: '\t' means TAB, '\r' means carriage re‐
         turn, '\n' means newline, and '\b' means bell.  Any octal value can be specified with '\nnn', where nnn  is  any  positive
         octal  number  less  than  0400.  Any hexadecimal value can be specified with '\xnn', where nn is any positive hexadecimal
         number less than or equal to 0xff.

       colon-separated hexadecimal list

         A list of hexadecimal octet values, separated by colons, may be specified as a data expression.

       concat (data-expr1, ..., data-exprN)
         The expressions are evaluated, and the results of each evaluation are concatenated in the sequence that the subexpressions
         are listed.  If any subexpression evaluates to null, the result of the concatenation is null.

       reverse (numeric-expr1, data-expr2)
         The two expressions are evaluated, and then the result of evaluating the data expression is reversed in place, using hunks
         of the size specified in the numeric expression.  For example, if the numeric expression evaluates to four, and  the  data
         expression  evaluates to twelve bytes of data, then the reverse expression will evaluate to twelve bytes of data, consist‐
         ing of the last four bytes of the input data, followed by the middle four bytes, followed by the first four bytes.

       leased-address
         In any context where the client whose request is being processed has been assigned an IP address, this data expression re‐
         turns  that  IP address.  In any context where the client whose request is being processed has not been assigned an ip ad‐
         dress, if this data expression is found in executable statements executed on that client's behalf, a log message  indicat‐
         ing  "there is no lease associated with this client" is syslogged to the debug level (this is considered dhcpd.conf debug‐
         ging information).

       binary-to-ascii (numeric-expr1, numeric-expr2, data-expr1, data-expr2)
         Converts the result of evaluating data-expr2 into a text string containing one number for each element of  the  result  of
         evaluating  data-expr2.   Each  number  is separated from the other by the result of evaluating data-expr1.  The result of
         evaluating numeric-expr1 specifies the base (2 through 16) into which the numbers should  be  converted.   The  result  of
         evaluating numeric-expr2 specifies the width in bits of each number, which may be either 8, 16 or 32.

         As  an  example  of the preceding three types of expressions, to produce the name of a PTR record for the IP address being
         assigned to a client, one could write the following expression:

               concat (binary-to-ascii (10, 8, ".",
                                        reverse (1, leased-address)),
                       ".in-addr.arpa.");

       encode-int (numeric-expr, width)
         Numeric-expr is evaluated and encoded as a data string of the specified width, in network  byte  order  (most  significant
         byte first).  If the numeric expression evaluates to the null value, the result is also null.

       pick-first-value (data-expr1 [ ... exprn ] )
         The pick-first-value function takes any number of data expressions as its arguments.  Each expression is evaluated, start‐
         ing with the first in the list, until an expression is found that does not evaluate to a null value.  That  expression  is
         returned,  and  none  of  the subsequent expressions are evaluated.  If all expressions evaluate to a null value, the null
         value is returned.

       host-decl-name
         The host-decl-name function returns the name of the host declaration that matched the client whose  request  is  currently
         being processed, if any.  If no host declaration matched, the result is the null value.

NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS
       Numeric expressions are expressions that evaluate to an integer.  In general, the maximum size of such an integer should not
       be assumed to be representable in fewer than 32 bits, but the precision of such integers may be more than 32 bits.

       In addition to the following operators several standard math functions are available.  They are:
       operation    symbol
       add            +
       subtract       -
       divide         /
       multiply       *
       modulus        %
       bitwise and    &amp;
       bitwise or     |
       bitwise xor    ^

       extract-int (data-expr, width)

         The extract-int operator extracts an integer value in network byte order from the result of evaluating the specified  data
         expression.  Width is the width in bits of the integer to extract.  Currently, the only supported widths are 8, 16 and 32.
         If the evaluation of the data expression doesn't provide sufficient bits to extract an integer of the specified size,  the
         null value is returned.

       lease-time

         The duration of the current lease - that is, the difference between the current time and the time that the lease expires.

       number

         Any number between zero and the maximum representable size may be specified as a numeric expression.

       client-state

         The current state of the client instance being processed.  This is only useful in DHCP client configuration files.  Possi‐
         ble values are:

         • Booting - DHCP client is in the INIT state, and does not yet have an IP address.  The next message transmitted will be a
           DHCPDISCOVER, which will be broadcast.

         • Reboot  -  DHCP client is in the INIT-REBOOT state.  It has an IP address, but is not yet using it.  The next message to
           be transmitted will be a DHCPREQUEST, which will be broadcast.  If no response is heard, the client will bind to its ad‐
           dress and move to the BOUND state.

         • Select  -  DHCP client is in the SELECTING state - it has received at least one DHCPOFFER message, but is waiting to see
           if it may receive other DHCPOFFER messages from other servers.  No messages are sent in the SELECTING state.

         • Request - DHCP client is in the REQUESTING state - it has received at least one DHCPOFFER message, and has chosen  which
           one it will request.  The next message to be sent will be a DHCPREQUEST message, which will be broadcast.

         • Bound - DHCP client is in the BOUND state - it has an IP address.  No messages are transmitted in this state.

         • Renew  -  DHCP  client is in the RENEWING state - it has an IP address, and is trying to contact the server to renew it.
           The next message to be sent will be a DHCPREQUEST message, which will be unicast directly to the server.

         • Rebind - DHCP client is in the REBINDING state - it has an IP address, and is trying to contact any server to renew  it.
           The next message to be sent will be a DHCPREQUEST, which will be broadcast.

REFERENCE: ACTION EXPRESSIONS
       log (priority, data-expr)

         Logging  statements may be used to send information to the standard logging channels.  A logging statement includes an op‐
         tional priority (fatal, error, info, or debug), and a data expression.

         Logging statements take only a single data expression argument, so if you want to output multiple data  values,  you  will
         need to use the concat operator to concatenate them.

       execute (command-path [, data-expr1, ... data-exprN]);

         The execute statement runs an external command.  The first argument is a string literal containing the name or path of the
         command to run.  The other arguments, if present, are either string literals or data- expressions which evaluate  to  text
         strings, to be passed as command-line arguments to the command.

         execute  is  synchronous;  the  program  will  block  until the external command being run has finished.  Please note that
         lengthy program execution (for example, in an "on commit" in dhcpd.conf) may result in bad performance and timeouts.  Only
         external applications with very short execution times are suitable for use.

         Passing user-supplied data to an external application might be dangerous.  Make sure the external application checks input
         buffers for validity.  Non-printable ASCII characters will be converted into dhcpd.conf language octal  escapes  ("\nnn"),
         make sure your external command handles them as such.

         It  is  possible to use the execute statement in any context, not only on events.  If you put it in a regular scope in the
         configuration file you will execute that command every time a scope is evaluated.

       parse-vendor-option;

         The parse-vendor-option statement attempts to parse a vendor option (code 43).  It  is  only  useful  while  processing  a
         packet  on  the  server and requires that the administrator has already used the vendor-option-space statement to select a
         valid vendor space.

         This functionality may be used if the server needs to take different actions depending on the values the client placed  in
         the vendor option and the sub-options are not at fixed locations.  It is handled as an action to allow an administrator to
         examine the incoming options and choose the correct vendor space.
