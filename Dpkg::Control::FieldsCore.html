NAME
       Dpkg::Control::FieldsCore - manage (list of official) control fields

DESCRIPTION
       The modules contains a list of fieldnames with associated meta-data explaining in which type of control information they are
       allowed. The types are the CTRL_* constants exported by Dpkg::Control.

FUNCTIONS
       $f = field_capitalize($field_name)
           Returns the field name properly capitalized. All characters are lowercase, except the first of each word (words are
           separated by a hyphen in field names).

       $bool = field_is_official($fname)
           Returns true if the field is official and known.

       $bool = field_is_allowed_in($fname, @types)
           Returns true (1) if the field $fname is allowed in all the types listed in the list. Note that you can use type sets
           instead of individual types (ex: CTRL_FILE_CHANGES | CTRL_CHANGELOG).

           field_allowed_in(A|B, C) returns true only if the field is allowed in C and either A or B.

           Undef is returned for non-official fields.

       $new_field = field_transfer_single($from, $to, $field)
           If appropriate, copy the value of the field named $field taken from the $from Dpkg::Control object to the $to
           Dpkg::Control object.

           Official fields are copied only if the field is allowed in both types of objects. Custom fields are treated in a
           specific manner. When the target is not among CTRL_PKG_SRC, CTRL_PKG_DEB or CTRL_FILE_CHANGES, then they are always
           copied as is (the X- prefix is kept). Otherwise they are not copied except if the target object matches the target
           destination encoded in the field name. The initial X denoting custom fields can be followed by one or more letters among
           "S" (Source: corresponds to CTRL_PKG_SRC), "B" (Binary: corresponds to CTRL_PKG_DEB) or "C" (Changes: corresponds to
           CTRL_FILE_CHANGES).

           Returns undef if nothing has been copied or the name of the new field added to $to otherwise.

       @field_list = field_transfer_all($from, $to)
           Transfer all appropriate fields from $from to $to. Calls field_transfer_single() on all fields available in $from.

           Returns the list of fields that have been added to $to.

       @field_list = field_ordered_list($type)
           Returns an ordered list of fields for a given type of control information.  This list can be used to output the fields
           in a predictable order.  The list might be empty for types where the order does not matter much.

       ($source, $version) = field_parse_binary_source($ctrl)
           Parse the Source field in a binary package control stanza. The field contains the source package name where it was built
           from, and optionally a space and the source version enclosed in parenthesis if it is different from the binary version.

           Returns a list with the $source name, and the source $version, or undef or an empty list when $ctrl does not contain a
           binary package control stanza.  Neither $source nor $version are validated, but that can be done with
           Dpkg::Package::pkg_name_is_illegal() and Dpkg::Version::version_check().

       @field_list = field_list_src_dep()
           List of fields that contains dependencies-like information in a source Debian package.

       @field_list = field_list_pkg_dep()
           List of fields that contains dependencies-like information in a binary Debian package. The fields that express real
           dependencies are sorted from the stronger to the weaker.

       $dep_type = field_get_dep_type($field)
           Return the type of the dependency expressed by the given field. Can either be "normal" for a real dependency field (Pre-
           Depends, Depends, ...)  or "union" for other relation fields sharing the same syntax (Conflicts, Breaks, ...). Returns
           undef for fields which are not dependencies.

       $sep_type = field_get_sep_type($field)
           Return the type of the field value separator. Can be one of FIELD_SEP_UNKNOWN, FIELD_SEP_SPACE, FIELD_SEP_COMMA or
           FIELD_SEP_LINE.

       field_register($field, $allowed_types, %opts)
           Register a new field as being allowed in control information of specified types. %opts is optional.

       $bool = field_insert_after($type, $ref, @fields)
           Place field after another one ($ref) in output of control information of type $type.

           Return true if the field was inserted, otherwise false.

       $bool = field_insert_before($type, $ref, @fields)
           Place field before another one ($ref) in output of control information of type $type.

           Return true if the field was inserted, otherwise false.
