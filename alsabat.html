NAME
       alsabat - command-line sound tester for ALSA sound card driver

SYNOPSIS
       alsabat [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       ALSABAT(ALSA  Basic  Audio  Tester) is a simple command-line utility intended to help automate audio driver and sound server
       testing with little human interaction. ALSABAT can be used to test audio quality, stress test features and test audio before
       and after PM state changes.

       ALSABAT's  design  is  relatively  simple. ALSABAT plays an audio stream and captures the same stream in either a digital or
       analog loop back. It then compares the captured stream using a FFT to the original to determine if the test case  passes  or
       fails.

       ALSABAT  can either run wholly on the target machine being tested (standalone mode) or can run as a client/server mode where
       by alsabat client runs on the target and runs as a server on a separate tester machine. The  client/server  mode  still  re‐
       quires some manual interaction for synchronization, but this is actively being developed for future releases.

       The hardware testing configuration may require the use of an analog cable connecting target to tester machines or a cable to
       create an analog loopback if no loopback mode is available on the sound hardware that is being tested.  An  analog  loopback
       cable  can  be  used  to connect the "line in" to "line out" jacks to create a loopback. If only headphone and mic jacks (or
       combo jack) are available then the following simple circuit can be used to create an analog loopback :-

       If tinyalsa is installed in system, user can choose tinyalsa as backend lib of alsabat,  with  configure  option  "--enable-
       alsabat-backend-tiny".

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show syntax.

       -D     Select sound card to be tested by name.

       -P     Select the playback PCM device.

       -C     Select the capture PCM device.

       -f     Sample format
              Recognized sample formats are: U8 S16_LE S24_3LE S32_LE
              Some of these may not be available on selected hardware
              The available format shortcuts are:
              -f cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100]
              -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000]
              If no format is given S16_LE is used.

       -c     The number of channels. The default is one channel.  Valid values at the moment are 1 or 2.

       -r     Sampling rate in Hertz. The default rate is 44100 Hertz.  Valid values depends on hardware support.

       -n     Duration of generated signal.  The value could be either of the two forms:
              1. Decimal integer, means number of frames;
              2. Floating point with suffix 's', means number of seconds.
              The default is 2 seconds.

       -k     Sigma k value for analysis.
              The  analysis  function reads data from WAV file, run FFT against the data to get magnitude of frequency vectors, and
              then calculates the average value and standard deviation of frequency vectors. After that, we define a threshold:
              threshold = k * standard_deviation + mean_value
              Frequencies with amplitude larger than threshold will be recognized as a peak, and the frequency  with  largest  peak
              value will be recognized as a detected frequency.
              ALSABAT then compares the detected frequency to target frequency, to decide if the detecting passes or fails.
              The default value is 3.0.

       -F     Target  frequency  for  signal  generation  and  analysis,  in  Hertz.   The  default is 997.0 Hertz.  Valid range is
              (DC_THRESHOLD, 40% * Sampling rate).

       -p     Total number of periods to play or capture.

       --log=#
              Write stderr and stdout output to this log file.

       --file=#
              Input WAV file for playback.

       --saveplay=#
              Target WAV file to save capture test content.

       --local
              Internal loopback mode.  Playback, capture and analysis internal to ALSABAT only. This is intended for developers  to
              test new ALSABAT features as no audio is routed outside of ALSABAT.

       --standalone
              Add support for standalone mode where ALSABAT will run on a different machine to the one being tested.  In standalone
              mode, the sound data can be generated, playback and captured just like in normal mode, but will not be analyzed.  The
              ALSABAT  being  built without libfftw3 support is always in standalone mode.  The ALSABAT in normal mode can also by‐
              pass data analysis using option "--standalone".

       --roundtriplatency
              Round trip latency test.  Audio latency is the time delay as an audio signal passes through a system.  There are many
              kinds  of  audio latency metrics. One useful metric is the round trip latency, which is the sum of output latency and
              input latency.

       --snr-db=#
              Noise detection threshold in SNR (dB). 26dB indicates 5% noise in amplitude.  ALSABAT will return error if signal SNR
              is smaller than the threshold.

       --snr-pc=#
              Noise  detection threshold in percentage of noise amplitude (%).  ALSABAT will return error if the noise amplitude is
              larger than the threshold.

EXAMPLES
       alsabat -P plughw:0,0 -C plughw:0,0 -c 2 -f S32_LE -F 250
              Generate and play a sine wave of 250 Hertz with 2 channel and S32_LE format, and then capture and analyze.

       alsabat -P plughw:0,0 -C plughw:0,0 --file 500Hz.wav
              Play the RIFF WAV file "500Hz.wav" which contains 500 Hertz waveform LPCM data, and then capture and analyze.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns 0.
       If no peak be detected, returns -1001;
       If only DC be detected, returns -1002;
       If peak frequency does not match with the target frequency, returns -1003.

BUGS
       Currently only support RIFF WAV format with PCM data. Please report any bugs to the alsa-devel mailing list.
