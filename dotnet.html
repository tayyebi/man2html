                  [--runtimeconfig &lt;PATH&gt;]
                  &lt;PATH_TO_APPLICATION&gt; [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       The dotnet command has two functions:

       • It provides commands for working with .NET projects.

         For example, dotnet build builds a project.  Each command defines its own options and arguments.  All commands support the
         --help option for printing out brief documentation about how to use the command.

       • It runs .NET applications.

         You specify the path to an application .dll file to run the application.  To run the application means to find and execute
         the  entry  point, which in the case of console apps is the Main method.  For example, dotnet myapp.dll runs the myapp ap‐
         plication.  See .NET application deployment to learn about deployment options.

OPTIONS
       Different options are available for:

       • Displaying information about the environment.

       • Running a command.

       • Running an application.

   Options for displaying environment information and available commands
       The following options are available when dotnet is used by itself, without specifying a command or an  application  to  run.
       For example, dotnet --info or dotnet --version.  They print out information about the environment.

       • --info

         Prints  out detailed information about a .NET installation and the machine environment, such as the current operating sys‐
         tem, and commit SHA of the .NET version.

       • --version

       Prints out the version of the .NET SDK used by dotnet commands, which may be affected by a global.json file.  Available only
       when the SDK is installed.

       • --list-runtimes

         Prints  out  a list of the installed .NET runtimes.  An x86 version of the SDK lists only x86 runtimes, and an x64 version
         of the SDK lists only x64 runtimes.

       • --list-sdks

         Prints out a list of the installed .NET SDKs.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a list of available commands.

   Options for running a command
       The following options are for dotnet with a command.  For example, dotnet build --help or dotnet build --verbosity  diagnos‐
       tic.

       • -d|--diagnostics

         Enables diagnostic output.

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets  the  verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
         Not supported in every command.  See specific command page to determine if this option is available.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out documentation for a given command.  For example, dotnet build --help displays help for the build command.

       • command options

         Each command defines options specific to that command.  See specific command page for a list of available options.

   Options for running an application
       The following options are available when dotnet runs an application.  For example, dotnet --roll-forward Major myapp.dll.

       • --additionalprobingpath &lt;PATH&gt;

         Path containing probing policy and assemblies to probe.  Repeat the option to specify multiple paths.

       • --additional-deps &lt;PATH&gt;

         Path to an additional .deps.json file.  A deps.json file contains a list of dependencies,  compilation  dependencies,  and
         version  information  used  to  address  assembly  conflicts.   For  more  information,  see  Runtime  Configuration Files
         (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/specs/runtime-configuration-file.md) on GitHub.

       • --roll-forward &lt;SETTING&gt; **

         Controls how roll forward is applied to the app.  The SETTING can be one of the following values.  If not specified, Minor
         is the default.

         • LatestPatch - Roll forward to the highest patch version.  This disables minor version roll forward.

         • Minor  - Roll forward to the lowest higher minor version, if requested minor version is missing.  If the requested minor
           version is present, then the LatestPatch policy is used.

         • Major - Roll forward to lowest higher major version, and lowest minor version, if requested major  version  is  missing.
           If the requested major version is present, then the Minor policy is used.

         • LatestMinor - Roll forward to highest minor version, even if requested minor version is present.  Intended for component
           hosting scenarios.

         • LatestMajor - Roll forward to highest major and highest minor version, even if requested major is present.  Intended for
           component hosting scenarios.

         • Disable - Don’t roll forward.  Only bind to specified version.  This policy isn’t recommended for general use because it
           disables the ability to roll forward to the latest patches.  This value is only recommended for testing.

         With the exception of Disable, all settings will use the highest available patch version.

         Roll forward behavior can also be configured in a project file property, a runtime configuration file property, and an en‐
         vironment variable.  For more information, see Major-version runtime roll forward.

       • --fx-version &lt;VERSION&gt;

         Version of the .NET runtime to use to run the application.

         This  option  overrides  the version of the first framework reference in the application’s .runtimeconfig.json file.  This
         means it only works as expected if there’s just one framework reference.  If the application has more than  one  framework
         reference, using this option may cause errors.

   Options for running an application with the exec command
       The following options are available only when dotnet runs an application by using the exec command.  For example, dotnet ex‐
       ec --runtimeconfig myapp.runtimeconfig.json myapp.dll.

       • --depsfile &lt;PATH&gt;

         Path to a deps.json file.  A deps.json file is a configuration file that contains information about dependencies necessary
         to run the application.  This file is generated by the .NET SDK.

       • --runtimeconfig &lt;PATH&gt;

         Path  to a runtimeconfig.json file.  A runtimeconfig.json file contains run-time settings and is typically named &lt;applica‐
         tionname&gt;.runtimeconfig.json.  For more information, see .NET runtime configuration settings.
