<pre>E2SCRUB(8)                                            System Manager's Manual                                            E2SCRUB(8)

NAME
       e2scrub - check the contents of a mounted ext[234] file system

SYNOPSIS
       e2scrub [OPTION] MOUNTPOINT | DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       e2scrub  attempts  to check (but not repair) all metadata in a mounted ext[234] file system if the file system resides on an
       LVM logical volume.  The block device of the LVM logical volume can also be passed in.

       This program snapshots the volume and runs a file system check on the snapshot to look for corruption errors.  The LVM  vol‐
       ume  group must have at least 256MiB of unallocated space to dedicate to the snapshot or the logical volume will be skipped.
       The snapshot will be named lvname.e2scrub and udev will not create symbolic links to it under /dev/disk.  Every attempt will
       be made to remove the snapshots prior to running e2scrub, but in a dire situation it may be necessary to remove the snapshot
       manually.

       If no errors are found, fstrim can be called on the file system if it is mounted.  If errors are found, the file system will
       be  marked  as  having  errors.  The file system should be taken offline and e2fsck run as soon as possible, because e2scrub
       does not fix corruptions.  If the file system is not repaired, e2fsck will be run before the next mount.

OPTIONS
       -n     Print what commands e2scrub would execute to check the file system.  (Note: the commands will not  actually  be  exe‐
              cuted; however, since e2scrub needs to run some commands to query the system to determine what commands would be exe‐
              cuted, it still needs to be run as root.)

       -r     Remove the e2scrub snapshot and exit without checking anything.

       -t     Run fstrim(1) on the mounted file system if no errors are found.

       -V     Print version information and exit.

EXIT CODE
       The exit codes are the same as in e2fsck(8)
