NAME
       dpkg-checkbuilddeps - check build dependencies and conflicts

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-checkbuilddeps [option...]  [control-file]

DESCRIPTION
       This program checks the installed packages in the system against the build dependencies and build conflicts listed in the
       control file. If any are not met, it displays them and exits with a nonzero return code.

       By default, debian/control is read, but an alternate control filename may be specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       --admindir=dir
           Change the location of the dpkg database (since dpkg 1.14.0).  The default location is /var/lib/dpkg.

       -A  Ignore Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Conflicts-Arch lines (since dpkg 1.16.4).  Use when only arch-indep packages will be
           built, or combine with -B when only a source package is to be built.

       -B  Ignore Build-Depends-Indep and Build-Conflicts-Indep lines. Use when only arch-dep packages will be built, or combine
           with -A when only a source package is to be built.

       -I  Ignore built-in build depends and conflicts (since dpkg 1.18.2).  These are implicit dependencies that are usually
           required on a specific distribution, the so called Build-Essential package set.

       -d build-depends-string
       -c build-conflicts-string
           Use the given build dependencies/conflicts instead of those contained in the debian/control file (since dpkg 1.14.17).

       -a arch
           Check build dependencies/conflicts assuming that the package described in the control file is to be built for the given
           host architecture instead of the architecture of the current system (since dpkg 1.16.2).

       -P profile[,...]
           Check build dependencies/conflicts assuming that the package described in the control file is to be built for the given
           build profile(s) (since dpkg 1.17.2).  The argument is a comma-separated list of profile names.

       -?, --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DEB_BUILD_PROFILES
           If set, it will be used as the active build profile(s) for the package being built. It is a space separated list of
           profile names. Overridden by the -P option.

       DPKG_COLORS
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.

       DPKG_NLS
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are: 0 and 1 (default).

1.21.21                                                      2023-03-02                                      dpkg-checkbuilddeps(1)
