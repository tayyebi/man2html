<pre>fanotify_mark(2)                                        System Calls Manual                                        fanotify_mark(2)

NAME
       fanotify_mark - add, remove, or modify an fanotify mark on a filesystem object

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/fanotify.h&gt;

       int fanotify_mark(int fanotify_fd, unsigned int flags,
                         uint64_t mask, int dirfd,
                         const char *_Nullable pathname);

DESCRIPTION
       For an overview of the fanotify API, see fanotify(7).

       fanotify_mark() adds, removes, or modifies an fanotify mark on a filesystem object.  The caller must have read permission on
       the filesystem object that is to be marked.

       The fanotify_fd argument is a file descriptor returned by fanotify_init(2).

       flags is a bit mask describing the modification to perform.  It must include exactly one of the following values:

       FAN_MARK_ADD
              The events in mask will be added to the mark mask (or to the ignore mask).  mask must be nonempty or the error EINVAL
              will occur.

       FAN_MARK_REMOVE
              The  events  in argument mask will be removed from the mark mask (or from the ignore mask).  mask must be nonempty or
              the error EINVAL will occur.

       FAN_MARK_FLUSH
              Remove either all marks for filesystems, all marks for mounts, or all marks for directories and files from  the  fan‐
              otify  group.   If flags contains FAN_MARK_MOUNT, all marks for mounts are removed from the group.  If flags contains
              FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM, all marks for filesystems are removed from the group.  Otherwise, all marks for directories  and
              files  are  removed.   No flag other than, and at most one of, the flags FAN_MARK_MOUNT or FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM can be
              used in conjunction with FAN_MARK_FLUSH.  mask is ignored.

       If none of the values above is specified, or more than one is specified, the call fails with the error EINVAL.

       In addition, zero or more of the following values may be ORed into flags:

       FAN_MARK_DONT_FOLLOW
              If pathname is a symbolic link, mark the link itself, rather than the file to which it  refers.   (By  default,  fan‐
              otify_mark() dereferences pathname if it is a symbolic link.)

       FAN_MARK_ONLYDIR
              If the filesystem object to be marked is not a directory, the error ENOTDIR shall be raised.

       FAN_MARK_MOUNT
              Mark the mount specified by pathname.  If pathname is not itself a mount point, the mount containing pathname will be
              marked.  All directories, subdirectories, and the contained files of the mount will be monitored.  The  events  which
              require  that  filesystem  objects  are  identified  by  file  handles, such as FAN_CREATE, FAN_ATTRIB, FAN_MOVE, and
              FAN_DELETE_SELF, cannot be provided as a mask when flags contains FAN_MARK_MOUNT.  Attempting to do so will result in
              the error EINVAL being returned.  Use of this flag requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM (since Linux 4.20)
              Mark  the  filesystem  specified  by pathname.  The filesystem containing pathname will be marked.  All the contained
              files and directories of the filesystem from any mount point will be  monitored.   Use  of  this  flag  requires  the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_MARK_IGNORED_MASK
              The  events  in  mask  shall  be  added  to  or  removed  from  the  ignore mask.  Note that the flags FAN_ONDIR, and
              FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD have no effect when provided with this flag.  The effect  of  setting  the  flags  FAN_ONDIR,  and
              FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD  in  the  mark  mask on the events that are set in the ignore mask is undefined and depends on the
              Linux kernel version.  Specifically, prior to Linux 5.9, setting a mark mask on a file and a mark with ignore mask on
              its  parent  directory  would not result in ignoring events on the file, regardless of the FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD flag in
              the parent directory's mark mask.  When the ignore mask is updated with the FAN_MARK_IGNORED_MASK flag on a mark that
              was previously updated with the FAN_MARK_IGNORE flag, the update fails with EEXIST error.

       FAN_MARK_IGNORE (since Linux 6.0)
              This  flag  has  a similar effect as setting the FAN_MARK_IGNORED_MASK flag.  The events in mask shall be added to or
              removed from the ignore mask.  Unlike the FAN_MARK_IGNORED_MASK  flag,  this  flag  also  has  the  effect  that  the
              FAN_ONDIR,  and  FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD flags take effect on the ignore mask.  Specifically, unless the FAN_ONDIR flag is
              set with FAN_MARK_IGNORE, events on directories will not be ignored.  If the  flag  FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD  is  set  with
              FAN_MARK_IGNORE,  events  on children will be ignored.  For example, a mark on a directory with combination of a mask
              with FAN_CREATE event and FAN_ONDIR flag and an ignore mask with FAN_CREATE event and without  FAN_ONDIR  flag,  will
              result  in getting only the events for creation of sub-directories.  When using the FAN_MARK_IGNORE flag to add to an
              ignore mask of a mount, filesystem, or directory inode mark, the FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY flag must be specified.
              Failure to do so will results with EINVAL or EISDIR error.

       FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY
              The ignore mask shall survive modify events.  If this flag is not set, the ignore mask is cleared when a modify event
              occurs on the marked object.  Omitting this flag is typically used to suppress events (e.g., FAN_OPEN) for a specific
              file,  until  that  specific file's content has been modified.  It is far less useful to suppress events on an entire
              filesystem, or mount, or on all files inside a directory, until some file's content has been modified.  For this rea‐
              son, the FAN_MARK_IGNORE flag requires the FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY flag on a mount, filesystem, or directory in‐
              ode mark.  This flag cannot be removed from a mark once set.  When the ignore mask is updated without this flag on  a
              mark  that  was  previously updated with the FAN_MARK_IGNORE and FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY flags, the update fails
              with EEXIST error.

       FAN_MARK_IGNORE_SURV
              This is a synonym for (FAN_MARK_IGNORE|FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY).

       FAN_MARK_EVICTABLE (since Linux 5.19)
              When an inode mark is created with this flag, the inode object will not be pinned to the inode cache, therefore,  al‐
              lowing the inode object to be evicted from the inode cache when the memory pressure on the system is high.  The evic‐
              tion of the inode object results in the evictable mark also being lost.  When the mask of an evictable inode mark  is
              updated  without  using  the  FAN_MARK_EVICATBLE  flag,  the marked inode is pinned to inode cache and the mark is no
              longer evictable.  When the mask of a non-evictable inode mark is updated with the FAN_MARK_EVICTABLE flag, the inode
              mark remains non-evictable and the update fails with EEXIST error.  Mounts and filesystems are not evictable objects,
              therefore, an attempt to create a mount mark or a filesystem mark with the FAN_MARK_EVICTABLE flag,  will  result  in
              the  error  EINVAL.   For  example,  inode  marks can be used in combination with mount marks to reduce the amount of
              events from noninteresting paths.  The event listener reads events, checks if the path reported in the  event  is  of
              interest, and if it is not, the listener sets a mark with an ignore mask on the directory.  Evictable inode marks al‐
              low using this method for a large number of directories without the concern of pinning all inodes and exhausting  the
              system's memory.

       mask  defines  which  events  shall be listened for (or which shall be ignored).  It is a bit mask composed of the following
       values:

       FAN_ACCESS
              Create an event when a file or directory (but see BUGS) is accessed (read).

       FAN_MODIFY
              Create an event when a file is modified (write).

       FAN_CLOSE_WRITE
              Create an event when a writable file is closed.

       FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE
              Create an event when a read-only file or directory is closed.

       FAN_OPEN
              Create an event when a file or directory is opened.

       FAN_OPEN_EXEC (since Linux 5.0)
              Create an event when a file is opened with the intent to be executed.  See NOTES for additional details.

       FAN_ATTRIB (since Linux 5.1)
              Create an event when the metadata for a file or directory has changed.  An fanotify group that identifies  filesystem
              objects by file handles is required.

       FAN_CREATE (since Linux 5.1)
              Create an event when a file or directory has been created in a marked parent directory.  An fanotify group that iden‐
              tifies filesystem objects by file handles is required.

       FAN_DELETE (since Linux 5.1)
              Create an event when a file or directory has been deleted in a marked parent directory.  An fanotify group that iden‐
              tifies filesystem objects by file handles is required.

       FAN_DELETE_SELF (since Linux 5.1)
              Create  an event when a marked file or directory itself is deleted.  An fanotify group that identifies filesystem ob‐
              jects by file handles is required.

       FAN_FS_ERROR (since Linux 5.16)
              Create an event when a filesystem error leading to inconsistent filesystem metadata is detected.  An  additional  in‐
              formation  record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_ERROR is returned for each event in the read buffer.  An fanotify group
              that identifies filesystem objects by file handles is required.

              Events of such type are dependent on support from the underlying filesystem.  At the time of writing, only  the  ext4
              filesystem reports FAN_FS_ERROR events.

              See fanotify(7) for additional details.

       FAN_MOVED_FROM (since Linux 5.1)
              Create an event when a file or directory has been moved from a marked parent directory.  An fanotify group that iden‐
              tifies filesystem objects by file handles is required.

       FAN_MOVED_TO (since Linux 5.1)
              Create an event when a file or directory has been moved to a marked parent directory.  An fanotify group that identi‐
              fies filesystem objects by file handles is required.

       FAN_RENAME (since Linux 5.17)
              This  event  contains the same information provided by events FAN_MOVED_FROM and FAN_MOVED_TO, however is represented
              by a single event with up to two information records.  An fanotify group that identifies filesystem objects  by  file
              handles is required.  If the filesystem object to be marked is not a directory, the error ENOTDIR shall be raised.

       FAN_MOVE_SELF (since Linux 5.1)
              Create  an event when a marked file or directory itself has been moved.  An fanotify group that identifies filesystem
              objects by file handles is required.

       FAN_OPEN_PERM
              Create an event when a permission to open a file or directory is requested.  An fanotify file descriptor created with
              FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT or FAN_CLASS_CONTENT is required.

       FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM (since Linux 5.0)
              Create  an  event  when  a permission to open a file for execution is requested.  An fanotify file descriptor created
              with FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT or FAN_CLASS_CONTENT is required.  See NOTES for additional details.

       FAN_ACCESS_PERM
              Create an event when a permission to read a file or directory is requested.  An fanotify file descriptor created with
              FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT or FAN_CLASS_CONTENT is required.

       FAN_ONDIR
              Create  events  for  directories—for example, when opendir(3), readdir(3) (but see BUGS), and closedir(3) are called.
              Without this flag, events are created only for files.  In the context of directory entry events, such as  FAN_CREATE,
              FAN_DELETE,  FAN_MOVED_FROM,  and  FAN_MOVED_TO,  specifying the flag FAN_ONDIR is required in order to create events
              when subdirectory entries are modified (i.e., mkdir(2)/ rmdir(2)).

       FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD
              Events for the immediate children of marked directories shall be created.  The flag has no effect when marking mounts
              and  filesystems.  Note that events are not generated for children of the subdirectories of marked directories.  More
              specifically, the directory entry modification events FAN_CREATE, FAN_DELETE, FAN_MOVED_FROM,  and  FAN_MOVED_TO  are
              not  generated  for  any  entry  modifications  performed inside subdirectories of marked directories.  Note that the
              events FAN_DELETE_SELF and FAN_MOVE_SELF are not generated for children of marked directories.  To  monitor  complete
              directory trees it is necessary to mark the relevant mount or filesystem.

       The following composed values are defined:

       FAN_CLOSE
              A file is closed (FAN_CLOSE_WRITE|FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE).

       FAN_MOVE
              A file or directory has been moved (FAN_MOVED_FROM|FAN_MOVED_TO).

       The filesystem object to be marked is determined by the file descriptor dirfd and the pathname specified in pathname:

       •  If pathname is NULL, dirfd defines the filesystem object to be marked.

       •  If pathname is NULL, and dirfd takes the special value AT_FDCWD, the current working directory is to be marked.

       •  If pathname is absolute, it defines the filesystem object to be marked, and dirfd is ignored.

       •  If  pathname  is  relative, and dirfd does not have the value AT_FDCWD, then the filesystem object to be marked is deter‐
          mined by interpreting pathname relative the directory referred to by dirfd.

       •  If pathname is relative, and dirfd has the value AT_FDCWD, then the filesystem object to be marked is determined  by  in‐
          terpreting  pathname relative to the current working directory.  (See openat(2) for an explanation of why the dirfd argu‐
          ment is useful.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, fanotify_mark() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  An invalid file descriptor was passed in fanotify_fd.

       EBADF  pathname is relative but dirfd is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor.

       EEXIST The filesystem object indicated by dirfd and pathname has a mark that  was  updated  without  the  FAN_MARK_EVICTABLE
              flag, and the user attempted to update the mark with FAN_MARK_EVICTABLE flag.

       EEXIST The  filesystem object indicated by dirfd and pathname has a mark that was updated with the FAN_MARK_IGNORE flag, and
              the user attempted to update the mark with FAN_MARK_IGNORED_MASK flag.

       EEXIST The filesystem object indicated by dirfd and pathname has a mark  that  was  updated  with  the  FAN_MARK_IGNORE  and
              FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY flags, and the user attempted to update the mark only with FAN_MARK_IGNORE flag.

       EINVAL An invalid value was passed in flags or mask, or fanotify_fd was not an fanotify file descriptor.

       EINVAL The  fanotify  file descriptor was opened with FAN_CLASS_NOTIF or the fanotify group identifies filesystem objects by
              file handles and mask contains a flag for permission events (FAN_OPEN_PERM or FAN_ACCESS_PERM).

       EINVAL The group was initialized without FAN_REPORT_FID but one or more event types specified in the mask require it.

       EINVAL flags contains FAN_MARK_IGNORE, and either FAN_MARK_MOUNT or FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM, but does not  contain  FAN_MARK_IG‐
              NORED_SURV_MODIFY.

       EISDIR flags  contains  FAN_MARK_IGNORE, but does not contain FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY, and dirfd and pathname specify a
              directory.

       ENODEV The filesystem object indicated by dirfd and pathname is not associated with a filesystem that supports  fsid  (e.g.,
              fuse(4)).  tmpfs(5) did not support fsid prior to Linux 5.13.  This error can be returned only with an fanotify group
              that identifies filesystem objects by file handles.

       ENOENT The filesystem object indicated by dirfd and pathname does not exist.  This error also occurs when trying to remove a
              mark from an object which is not marked.

       ENOMEM The necessary memory could not be allocated.

       ENOSPC The  number of marks for this user exceeds the limit and the FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS flag was not specified when the fan‐
              otify file descriptor was created with fanotify_init(2).  See fanotify(7) for details about this limit.

       ENOSYS This kernel does not implement fanotify_mark().  The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was configured with
              CONFIG_FANOTIFY.

       ENOTDIR
              flags contains FAN_MARK_ONLYDIR, and dirfd and pathname do not specify a directory.

       ENOTDIR
              mask contains FAN_RENAME, and dirfd and pathname do not specify a directory.

       ENOTDIR
              flags  contains FAN_MARK_IGNORE, or the fanotify group was initialized with flag FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID, and mask con‐
              tains directory entry modification events (e.g., FAN_CREATE, FAN_DELETE), or directory event flags (e.g.,  FAN_ONDIR,
              FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD), and dirfd and pathname do not specify a directory.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              The  object indicated by pathname is associated with a filesystem that does not support the encoding of file handles.
              This error can be returned only with an fanotify group that identifies filesystem objects by file handles.

       EPERM  The operation is not permitted because the caller lacks a required capability.

       EXDEV  The filesystem object indicated by pathname resides within a filesystem subvolume (e.g., btrfs(5)) which uses a  dif‐
              ferent  fsid  than  its  root  superblock.   This  error  can be returned only with an fanotify group that identifies
              filesystem objects by file handles.

VERSIONS
       fanotify_mark() was introduced in Linux 2.6.36 and enabled in Linux 2.6.37.

STANDARDS
       This system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
   FAN_OPEN_EXEC and FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM
       When using either FAN_OPEN_EXEC or FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM within the mask, events of these types will be returned only when  the
       direct  execution of a program occurs.  More specifically, this means that events of these types will be generated for files
       that are opened using execve(2), execveat(2), or uselib(2).  Events of these types will not be raised in the situation where
       an interpreter is passed (or reads) a file for interpretation.

       Additionally,  if a mark has also been placed on the Linux dynamic linker, a user should also expect to receive an event for
       it when an ELF object has been successfully opened using execve(2) or execveat(2).

       For example, if the following ELF binary were to be invoked and a FAN_OPEN_EXEC mark has been placed on /:

           $ /bin/echo foo

       The listening application in this case would receive FAN_OPEN_EXEC events for both the ELF binary and  interpreter,  respec‐
       tively:

           /bin/echo
           /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

BUGS
       The following bugs were present in before Linux 3.16:

       •  If  flags contains FAN_MARK_FLUSH, dirfd, and pathname must specify a valid filesystem object, even though this object is
          not used.

       •  readdir(2) does not generate a FAN_ACCESS event.

       •  If fanotify_mark() is called with FAN_MARK_FLUSH, flags is not checked for invalid values.
