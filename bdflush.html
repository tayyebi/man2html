<pre>bdflush(2)                                              System Calls Manual                                              bdflush(2)

NAME
       bdflush - start, flush, or tune buffer-dirty-flush daemon

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/kdaemon.h&gt;

       [[deprecated]] int bdflush(int func, long *address);
       [[deprecated]] int bdflush(int func, long data);

DESCRIPTION
       Note:  Since  Linux  2.6, this system call is deprecated and does nothing.  It is likely to disappear altogether in a future
       kernel release.  Nowadays, the task performed by bdflush() is handled by the kernel pdflush thread.

       bdflush() starts, flushes, or tunes the buffer-dirty-flush daemon.  Only a privileged process (one  with  the  CAP_SYS_ADMIN
       capability) may call bdflush().

       If func is negative or 0, and no daemon has been started, then bdflush() enters the daemon code and never returns.

       If func is 1, some dirty buffers are written to disk.

       If  func  is 2 or more and is even (low bit is 0), then address is the address of a long word, and the tuning parameter num‚Äê
       bered (func-2)/2 is returned to the caller in that address.

       If func is 3 or more and is odd (low bit is 1), then data is a long word, and the  kernel  sets  tuning  parameter  numbered
       (func-3)/2 to that value.

       The set of parameters, their values, and their valid ranges are defined in the Linux kernel source file fs/buffer.c.

RETURN VALUE
       If  func  is negative or 0 and the daemon successfully starts, bdflush() never returns.  Otherwise, the return value is 0 on
       success and -1 on failure, with errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBUSY  An attempt was made to enter the daemon code after another process has already entered.

       EFAULT address points outside your accessible address space.

       EINVAL An attempt was made to read or write an invalid parameter number, or to write an invalid value to a parameter.

       EPERM  Caller does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

VERSIONS
       Since glibc 2.23, glibc no longer supports this obsolete system call.

STANDARDS
       bdflush() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
