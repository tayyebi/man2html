<pre>cracklib-format(8)                                    Debian GNU/Linux manual                                    cracklib-format(8)

NAME
       cracklib-format, cracklib-packer, cracklib-unpacker - cracklib dictionary utilities

SYNOPSIS
       cracklib-format file ...

       cracklib-packer cracklib_dictpath

       cracklib-unpacker cracklib_dictpath

DESCRIPTION
       cracklib-format  takes  a list of text files each containing a list of words, one per line, It lowercases all words, removes
       control characters, and sorts the lists.  It outputs the cleaned up list to standard output.  The text files may be  option‐
       ally compressed with gzip(1).

       If  you  supply  massive amounts of text to cracklib-format you must have enough free space available for use by the sort(1)
       command.  If you do not have 20Mb free in /var/tmp (or whatever temporary area your sort(1) command uses), have  a  look  at
       the  /usr/sbin/cracklib-format program which is a sh(1) program.  You can usually tweak the sort(1) command to use any large
       area of disk you desire, by use of the -T option.  cracklib-format has a hook for this.

       cracklib-packer reads from standard input a list of sorted and cleaned words and creates a database  in  the  directory  and
       prefix  given  by the command line argument cracklib_dictpath.  Three files are created with the suffixes of .hwm, .pwd, and
       .pwi.  These three files are in the format that the FascistCheck(3) subroutine, cracklib-unpacker(8), and cracklib-check(8),
       utilities understand.  The number of words read and written are printed on stdout(3).

       cracklib-unpacker  reads  from the database in the directory and prefix given by the command line argument cracklib_dictpath
       and outputs on standard output the list of words that make up the database.

       The database is in a binary format generated by the utilities cracklib-format(8) and cracklib-packer(8).  On a Debian system
       the  database  is  located  in  the  directory  /var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict  and  is  generated daily with the program
       /etc/cron.daily/cracklib.  The location is also defined in the header file  crack.h  using  the  constant  CRACKLIB_DICTPATH
       though none of the subroutines in the cracklib libraries have this location hardcoded into their implementations.

FILES
       /var/cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict.[hwm|pwd|pwi]
              cracklib dictionary database files used by utilities.

       /etc/cron.daily/cracklib
              cracklib daily cron program to rebuild the cracklib dictionary database.

       /etc/cracklib/cracklib.conf
              cracklib configuration file used by the cracklib daily cron program to rebuild the cracklib dictionary database.

       /usr/include/crack.h
              cracklib  header  file  defining the subroutine FascistCheck(3) and the constant CRACKLIB_DICTPATH used to compile in
              the location of the cracklib dictionary database for these utilities.

       /usr/sbin/cracklib-format
              cracklib shell script to create initial list of words for dictionary database.
