NAME
       cups-browsed.conf - server configuration file for cups-browsed

DESCRIPTION
       The  cups-browsed.conf file configures the cups-browsed daemon. It is normally located in the /etc/cups directory. Each line
       in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.

DIRECTIVES
       The "CacheDir" directive determines where cups-browsed should save information about the print queues it had generated  when
       shutting down, like whether one of these queues was the default printer, or default option settings of the queues.

               CacheDir /var/cache/cups-browsed

       With "LogDir" can be defined where cups-browsed creates its debug log file (if "DebugLogging file" is set).

               LogDir /var/log/cups-browsed

       The  "DebugLogging"  directive  determines  how  should  debug  logging  be done.  Into the file /var/log/cups-browsed/cups-
       browsed_log ("file"), to stderr ("stderr"), or not at all ("none").

       Note that if cups-browsed is running as a system service (for example via systemd) logging to stderr makes  the  log  output
       going  to  the  journal or syslog. Only if you run cups-browsed from the command line (for development or debugging) it will
       actually appear on stderr.

               DebugLogging file
               DebugLogging stderr
               DebugLogging file stderr
               DebugLogging none

       Only browse remote printers (via DNS-SD or CUPS browsing) from selected servers using the "BrowseAllow",  "BrowseDeny",  and
       "BrowseOrder" directives

       This  serves  for  restricting  the choice of printers in print dialogs to trusted servers or to reduce the number of listed
       printers in the print dialogs to a more user-friendly amount in large networks with very many shared printers.

       This only filters the selection of remote printers for which cups-browsed creates local queues. If  the  print  dialog  uses
       other  mechanisms  to  list remote printers as for example direct DNS-SD access, cups-browsed has no influence. cups-browsed
       also does not prevent the user from manually accessing non-listed printers.

       "BrowseAllow": Accept printers from these hosts or networks. If there are only  "BrowseAllow"  lines  and  no  "BrowseOrder"
       and/or "BrowseDeny" lines, only servers matching at last one "BrowseAllow" line are accepted.

       "BrowseDeny":  Deny  printers from these hosts or networks. If there are only "BrowseDeny" lines and no "BrowseOrder" and/or
       "BrowseAllow" lines, all servers NOT matching any of the "BrowseDeny" lines are accepted.

       "BrowseOrder": Determine the order in which "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" lines are applied. With "BrowseOrder  Deny,Allow"
       in  the  beginning all servers are accepted, then the "BrowseDeny" lines are applied to exclude unwished servers or networks
       and after that the "BrowseAllow" lines to re-include servers or networks. With "BrowseOrder Allow,Deny" we start with  deny‐
       ing all servers, then applying the "BrowseAllow" lines and afterwards the "BrowseDeny" lines.

       Default for "BrowseOrder" is "Deny.Allow" if there are both "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" lines.

       If there are no "Browse..." lines at all, all servers are accepted.

               BrowseAllow All
               BrowseAllow 192.168.7.20
               BrowseAllow 192.168.7.0/24
               BrowseAllow 192.168.7.0/255.255.255.0

               BrowseDeny All
               BrowseDeny 192.168.1.13
               BrowseDeny 192.168.3.0/24
               BrowseDeny 192.168.3.0/255.255.255.0

               BrowseOrder Deny,Allow
               BrowseOrder Allow,Deny

       Filtering of remote printers by other properties than IP addresses of their servers

       Often  the  desired selection of printers cannot be reached by only taking into account the IP addresses of the servers. For
       these cases there is the BrowseFilter directive to filter by most of the known properties of the printer.

       By default there is no BrowseFilter line meaning that no filtering is applied.

       To do filtering one can supply one or more BrowseFilter directives like this:

               BrowseFilter [NOT] [EXACT] &lt;FIELD&gt; [&lt;VALUE&gt;]

       The BrowseFilter directive always starts with the word "BrowseFilter" and it must at least contain  the  name  of  the  data
       field (&lt;FIELD&gt;) of the printer's properties to which it should apply.

       Available field names are:

               name:    Name of the local print queue to be created
               host:    Host name of the remote print server
               port:    Port through which the printer is accessed on the server
               service: DNS/SD service name of the remote printer
               domain:  Domain of the remote print server

       Also  all  field names in the TXT records of DNS-SD-advertised printers are valid, like "color", "duplex", "pdl", ... If the
       field name of the filter rule does not exist for the printer, the rule is skipped.

       The optional &lt;VALUE&gt; field is either the exact value (when the option EXACT is supplied) or a regular expression (Run "man 7
       regex" in a terminal window) to be matched with the data field.

       If  no  &lt;VALUE&gt; filed is supplied, rules with field names of the TXT record are considered for boolean matching (true/false)
       of boolean field (like duplex, which can have the values "T" for true and "F" for false).

       If the option NOT is supplied, the filter rule is fulfilled if the regular expression or the exact value DOES NOT match  the
       content of the data field. In a boolean rule (without &lt;VALUE&gt;) the rule matches false.

       Regular  expressions  are always considered case-insensitive and extended POSIX regular expressions. Field names and options
       (NOT, EXACT) are all evaluated case-insensitive. If there is an error in a regular expression, the  BrowseFilter  line  gets
       ignored.

       Especially  to  note is that supplying any simple string consisting of only letters, numbers, spaces, and some basic special
       characters as a regular expression matches if it is contained somewhere in the data field.

       If there is more than one BrowseFilter directive, ALL the directives need to be fulfilled for the remote printer to  be  ac‐
       cepted. If one is not fulfilled, the printer will get ignored.

       Examples:

       Rules for standard data items which are supplied with any remote printer advertised via DNS-SD:

       Print queue name must contain "hum_res_", this matches "hum_res_mono" or "hum_res_color" but also "old_hum_res_mono":

               BrowseFilter name hum_res_

       This  matches  if  the  remote host name contains "printserver", like "printserver.local", "printserver2.example.com", "new‐
       printserver":

               BrowseFilter host printserver

       This matches all ports with 631 int its number, for example 631, 8631, 10631,...:

               BrowseFilter port 631

       This rule matches if the DNS-SD service name contains "@ printserver":

               Browsefilter service @ printserver

       Matches all domains with "local" in their names, not only "local" but also things like "printlocally.com":

               BrowseFilter domain local

       Examples for rules applying to items of the TXT record:

       This rule selects PostScript printers, as the "PDL" field in the TXT record contains "postscript" then. This  includes  also
       remote  CUPS queues which accept PostScript, independent of whether the physical printer behind the CUPS queue accepts Post‐
       Script or not.

               BrowseFilter pdl postscript

       Color printers usually contain a "Color" entry set to "T" (for true) in the TXT record. This rule selects them:

               BrowseFilter color

       This is a similar rule to select only duplex (automatic double-sided printing) printers:

               BrowseFilter duplex

       Rules with the NOT option:

       This rule EXCLUDES printers from all hosts containing "financial" in their names, nice to get rid of the 100s of printers of
       the financial department:

               BrowseFilter NOT host financial

       Get only monochrome printers ("Color" set to "F", meaning false, in the TXT record):

               BrowseFilter NOT color

       Rules with more advanced use of regular expressions:

       Only  queue  names  which  BEGIN WITH "hum_res_" are accepted now, so we still get "hum_res_mono" or "hum_res_color" but not
       "old_hum_res_mono" any more:

               BrowseFilter name ^hum_res_

       Server names is accepted if it contains "print_server" OR "graphics_dep_server":

               BrowseFilter host print_server|graphics_dep_server

       "printserver1", "printserver2", and "printserver3", nothing else:

               BrowseFilter host ^printserver[1-3]$

       Printers understanding at least one of PostScript, PCL, or PDF:

               BrowseFilter pdl postscript|pcl|pdf

       Examples for the EXACT option:

       Only printers from "printserver.local" are accepted:

               BrowseFilter EXACT host printserver.local

       Printers from all servers except "prinserver2.local" are accepted:

               BrowseFilter NOT EXACT host prinserver2.local

       The BrowsePoll directive polls a server for available printers once every 60 seconds. Multiple BrowsePoll directives can  be
       specified  to  poll multiple servers. The default port to connect to is 631.  BrowsePoll works independently of whether CUPS
       browsing is activated in BrowseRemoteProtocols.

               BrowsePoll 192.168.7.20
               BrowsePoll 192.168.7.65:631
               BrowsePoll host.example.com:631

       The BrowseLocalProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use when advertising local shared printers on the network. The
       default is "none". Control of advertising of local shared printers using dnssd is done in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.

               BrowseLocalProtocols none
               BrowseLocalProtocols CUPS

       The  BrowseRemoteProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use when finding remote shared printers on the network. Mul‐
       tiple protocols can be specified by separating them with spaces.  The default is "dnssd cups".

               BrowseRemoteProtocols none
               BrowseRemoteProtocols CUPS dnssd
               BrowseRemoteProtocols CUPS
               BrowseRemoteProtocols dnssd
               BrowseRemoteProtocols ldap

       The BrowseProtocols directive specifies the protocols to use when finding remote shared printers on the network  and  adver‐
       tising  local shared printers. "dnssd" and "ldap" are ignored for BrowseLocalProtocols.  Multiple protocols can be specified
       by separating them with spaces. The default is "none" for BrowseLocalProtocols and "dnssd cups" for BrowseRemoteProtocols.

               BrowseProtocols none
               BrowseProtocols CUPS dnssd
               BrowseProtocols CUPS
               BrowseProtocols dnssd
               BrowseProtocols ldap

       The configuration for the LDAP browsing mode define where the LDAP search should be performed. If built with an LDAP library
       that  supports TLS, the path to the server's certificate, or to a certificates store, can be specified.  The optional filter
       allows the LDAP search to be more specific, and is used in addition to the hardcoded filter (objectclass=cupsPrinter).

               BrowseLDAPBindDN cn=cups-browsed,dc=domain,dc=tld
               BrowseLDAPCACertFile /path/to/server/certificate.pem
               BrowseLDAPDN ou=printers,dc=domain,dc=tld
               BrowseLDAPFilter (printerLocation=/Office 1/*)
               BrowseLDAPPassword s3cret
               BrowseLDAPServer ldaps://ldap.domain.tld

       The DomainSocket directive specifies the domain socket through which the locally running CUPS daemon  is  accessed.  If  not
       specified  the  standard domain socket of CUPS is used. Use this if you have specified an alternative domain socket for CUPS
       via a Listen directive in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. If cups-browsed is not able to access the local CUPS  daemon  via  a  domain
       socket it accesses it via localhost. "None" or "Off" lets cups-browsed not use CUPS' domain socket.

               DomainSocket /var/run/cups/cups.sock
               DomainSocket None
               DomainSocket Off

       Set  HTTP  timeout  (in  seconds) for requests sent to local/remote resources Note that too short timeouts can make services
       getting missed when they are present and operations be unnecessarily repeated and too long timeouts can make operations take
       too long when the server does not respond.

               HttpLocalTimeout 5
               HttpRemoteTimeout 10

       Set  how many retries (N) should cups-browsed do for creating print queues for remote printers which receive timeouts during
       print queue creation.  The printers which are not successfully set up even after N  retries,  are  skipped  until  the  next
       restart of the service.  Note that too many retries can cause high CPU load.

               HttpMaxRetries 5

       The interval between browsing/broadcasting cycles, local and/or remote, can be adjusted with the BrowseInterval directive.

               BrowseInterval 60

       The  BrowseTimeout  directive determines the amount of time that browsing-related operations are allowed to take in seconds.
       Notably, adding or removing one printer queue is considered as one operation. The timeout applies to each one of those oper‐
       ations.  Especially queues discovered by CUPS broadcasts will be removed after this timeout if no further broadcast from the
       server happens.

               BrowseTimeout 300

       The AllowResharingRemoteCUPSPrinters directive determines whether a print queue pointing to a remote CUPS queue will be  re-
       shared  to  the  local network or not. Since the queues generated using the BrowsePoll directive are also pointing to remote
       queues, they are also shared automatically if the following option is set. Default is not to share remote queues.

               AllowResharingRemoteCUPSPrinters Yes

       The NewBrowsePollQueuesShared directive determines whether a print queue for a newly discovered printer (discovered  by  the
       BrowsePoll  directive) will be shared to the local network or not. This directive will only work if AllowResharingRemoteCUP‐
       SPrinters is set to yes. Default is not to share printers discovered using BrowsePoll.

               NewBrowsePollQueuesShared Yes

       Set OnlyUnsupportedByCUPS to "Yes" will make cups-browsed not create local queues for remote printers for which CUPS creates
       queues  by itself.  These printers are printers advertised via DNS-SD and doing CUPS-supported (currently PWG Raster and Ap‐
       ple Raster) driverless printing, including remote CUPS queues. Queues for other printers  (like  for  legacy  PostScript/PCL
       printers) are always created (depending on the other configuration settings of cups-browsed).

       With  OnlyUnsupportedByCUPS  set to "No", cups-browsed creates queues for all printers which it supports, including printers
       for which CUPS would create queues by itself. Temporary queues created by CUPS will get overwritten. This way it is  assured
       that  any  extra  functionality  of cups-browsed will apply to these queues. As queues created by cups-browsed are permanent
       CUPS queues this setting is also recommended if applications/print dialogs which do not support temporary  CUPS  queues  are
       installed. This setting is the default.

               OnlyUnsupportedByCUPS Yes

       With UseCUPSGeneratedPPDs set to "Yes" cups-browsed creates queues for IPP printers with PPDs generated by the PPD generator
       of CUPS and not with the one of cups-browsed. So any new development in CUPS' PPD generator gets  available.  As  CUPS'  PPD
       generator  is not directly accessible, we need to make CUPS generate a temporary print queue with the desired PPD. Therefore
       we can only use these PPDs when our queue replaces a temporary CUPS queue, meaning that the queue is for a printer on  which
       CUPS  supports  driverless  printing  (IPP 2.x, PDLs: PDF, PWG Raster, and/or Apple Raster) and that its name is the same as
       CUPS uses for the temporary queue ("LocalQueueNamingIPPPrinter DNS-SD" must be set).  The  directive  applies  only  to  IPP
       printers,  not to remote CUPS queues, to not break clustering. Setting this directive to "No" lets cups-browsed generate the
       PPD file. Default setting is "No".

               UseCUPSGeneratedPPDs No

       With the directives LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS and LocalQueueNamingIPPPrinter you can determine  how  the  names  for  local
       queues generated by cups-browsed are generated, separately for remote CUPS printers and IPP printers.

       "DNS-SD" (the default in both cases) bases the naming on the service name of the printer's advertised DNS-SD record. This is
       exactly the same naming scheme as CUPS uses for its temporary queues, so the local queue  from  cups-browsed  prevents  CUPS
       from  listing and creating an additional queue. As DNS-SD service names have to be unique, queue names of printers from dif‐
       ferent servers will also be unique and so there is no automatic clustering for load-balanced printing.

       "MakeModel" bases the queue name on the printer's manufacturer and model names. This scheme cups-browsed used  formerly  for
       IPP printers.

       "RemoteName"  is only available for remote CUPS queues and uses the name of the queue on the remote CUPS server as the local
       queue's name. This makes printers on different CUPS servers with equal queue names automatically  forming  a  load-balancing
       cluster  as  CUPS  did  formerly (CUPS 1.5.x and older) with CUPS-broadcasted remote printers. This scheme cups-browsed used
       formerly for remote CUPS printers.

               LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS DNS-SD
               LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS MakeModel
               LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS RemoteName
               LocalQueueNamingIPPPrinter DNS-SD
               LocalQueueNamingIPPPrinter MakeModel

       Set DNSSDBasedDeviceURIs to "Yes" if cups-browsed should use DNS-SD-service-name-based device URIs for its local queues,  as
       CUPS also does. These queues use the DNS-SD service name of the discovered printer. With this the URI is independent of net‐
       work interfaces and ports, giving reliable connections to always the same physical device. This setting is the default.

       Set DNSSDBasedDeviceURIs to "No" if cups-browsed should use the conventional host-name/IP-based URIs.

       Note that this option has only influence on URIs for printers discovered via DNS-SD, not via legacy CUPS broewsing or  LDAP.
       Those printers get always assigned the conventional URIs.

               DNSSDBasedDeviceURIs Yes

       Set IPBasedDeviceURIs to "Yes" if cups-browsed should create its local queues with device URIs with the IP addresses instead
       of the host names of the remote servers. This mode is there for any problems with host name resolution in the network, espe‐
       cially also if avahi-daemon is only run for printer discovery and already stopped while still printing. By default this mode
       is turned off, meaning that we use URIs with host names.

       Note that the IP addresses depend on the network interface through which the printer is accessed. So  do  not  use  IP-based
       URIs on systems with many network interfaces and where interfaces can appear and disappear frequently.

       This mode could also be useful for development and debugging.

       If  you  prefer IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses in the URIs, you can set IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv4" to only get IPv4 IP addresses
       or IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv6" to only get IPv6 IP addresses.

               IPBasedDeviceURIs No
               IPBasedDeviceURIs Yes
               IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv4
               IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv6

       Set CreateRemoteRawPrinterQueues to "Yes" to let cups-browsed also create local queues pointing to remote raw  CUPS  queues.
       Normally, only queues pointing to remote queues with PPD/driver are created as we do not use drivers on the client side, but
       in some cases accessing a remote raw queue can make sense, for example if the queue forwards the jobs by a  special  backend
       like Tea4CUPS.

               CreateRemoteRawPrinterQueues Yes

       cups-browsed by default creates local print queues for each shared CUPS print queue which it discovers on remote machines in
       the local network(s). Set CreateRemoteCUPSPrinterQueues to "No" if you do not want cups-browsed to do this. For example  you
       can set cups-browsed to only create queues for IPP network printers setting CreateIPPPrinterQueues not to "No" and CreateRe‐
       moteCUPSPrinterQueues to "No".

               CreateRemoteCUPSPrinterQueues No

       Set CreateIPPPrinterQueues to "All" to let cups-browsed discover IPP network printers (native  printers,  not  CUPS  queues)
       with  known  page description languages (PWG Raster, PDF, PostScript, PCL XL, PCL 5c/e) in the local network and auto-create
       print queues for them.

       Set CreateIPPPrinterQueues to "Everywhere" to let cups-browsed discover IPP Everywhere printers in the local network (native
       printers, not CUPS queues) and auto-create print queues for them.

       Set  CreateIPPPrinterQueues to "AppleRaster" to let cups-browsed discover Apple Raster printers in the local network (native
       printers, not CUPS queues) and auto-create print queues for them.

       Set CreateIPPPrinterQueues to "Driverless" to let cups-browsed discover printers designed for driverless use (currently  IPP
       Everywhere and Apple Raster) in the local network (native printers, not CUPS queues) and auto-create print queues for them.

       Set  CreateIPPPrinterQueues  to "LocalOnly" to auto-create print queues only for local printers made available as IPP print‐
       ers. These are for example IPP-over-USB printers, made available via ippusbxd(8). This is the default.

       Set CreateIPPPrinterQueues to "No" to not auto-create print queues for IPP network printers.

       The PPDs are auto-generated by cups-browsed based on properties of the printer polled via IPP. In case of  missing  informa‐
       tion, info from the Bonjour record is used as last mean for the default values.

       This functionality is primarily for mobile devices running CUPS to not need a printer setup tool nor a collection of printer
       drivers and PPDs.

       The NewIPPPrinterQueuesShared directive determines whether a print queue for a newly discovered IPP network printer (not re‐
       mote  CUPS queue) will be shared to the local network or not. This is only valid for newly discovered printers. For printers
       discovered in an earlier cups-browsed session, cups-browsed will remember whether the printer was shared, so changes by  the
       user get conserved. Default is not to share newly discovered IPP printers.

       How to handle the print queues cups-browsed creates when cups-browsed is shut down:

       "KeepGeneratedQueuesOnShutdown  No"  makes  the queues being removed. This makes sense as these queues only work while cups-
       browsed is running. cups-browsed has to determine to which member printer of a cluster to pass on the job.

       "KeepGeneratedQueuesOnShutdown Yes" (the default) makes the queues not being removed. This is the recommended setting for  a
       system  where  cups-browsed is permanently running and only stopped for short times (like log rotation) or on shutdown. This
       avoids the re-creation of the queues when cups-browsed is restarted, which often causes a clutter of CUPS  notifications  on
       the desktop.

               KeepGeneratedQueuesOnShutdown No

       If  there  is more than one remote CUPS printer whose local queue would get the same name and AutoClustering is set to "Yes"
       (the default) only one local queue is created which makes up a load-balancing cluster of the remote printers which would get
       this  queue name (implicit class). This means that when several jobs are sent to this queue they get distributed between the
       printers, using the method chosen by the LoadBalancing directive.

       Note that the forming of clusters depends on the naming scheme for local queues created by cups-browsed. If you have set Lo‐
       calQueueNamingRemoteCUPS  to  "DNSSD"  you  will not get automatic clustering as the DNS-SD service names are always unique.
       With LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS set to "RemoteName" local queues are named as the CUPS queues  on  the  remote  servers  are
       named  and  so  equally named queues on different servers get clustered (this is how CUPS did it in version 1.5.x or older).
       LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS set to "MakeModel" makes remote printers of the same model get clustered. Note that then a  clus‐
       ter can contain more than one queue of the same server.

       With  AutoClustering  set  to  "No",  for  each  remote CUPS printer an individual local queue is created, and to avoid name
       clashes when using the LocalQueueNamingRemoteCUPS settings "RemoteName" or "MakeModel" "@&lt;server name&gt;" is added to the  lo‐
       cal queue name.

       Only remote CUPS printers get clustered, not IPP network printers or IPP-over-USB printers.

               AutoClustering Yes
               AutoClustering No

       Load-balancing  printer  cluster formation can also be manually controlled by defining explicitly which remote CUPS printers
       should get clustered together.

       This is done by the "Cluster" directive:

               Cluster &lt;QUEUENAME&gt;: &lt;EXPRESSION1&gt; &lt;EXPRESSION2&gt; ...
               Cluster &lt;QUEUENAME&gt;

       If no expressions are given, &lt;QUEUENAME&gt; is used as the first and only expression for this cluster.

       Discovered printers are matched against all the expressions of all defined clusters. The first expression which matches  the
       discovered printer determines to which cluster it belongs. Note that this way a printer can only belong to one cluster. Once
       matched, further cluster definitions will not checked any more.

       With the first printer matching a cluster's expression a local queue with the name &lt;QUEUENAME&gt; is created. If more  printers
       are discovered and match this cluster, they join the cluster. Printing to this queue prints to all these printers in a load-
       balancing manner, according to to the setting of the LoadBalancing directive.

       Each expression must be a string of characters without spaces. If spaces are needed, replace them by underscores ('_').

       An expression can be matched in three ways:

           1. By the name of the CUPS queue on the remote server
           2. By make and model name of the remote printer
           3. By the DNS-SD service name of the remote printer

       Note that the matching is done case-insensitively and any group of non-alphanumerical characters is replaced by a single un‐
       derscore.

       So  if  an  expression is "HP_DeskJet_2540" and the remote server reports "hp Deskjet-2540" the printer gets matched to this
       cluster.

       If "AutoClustering" is not set to "No" both your manual cluster definitions will be followed  and  automatic  clustering  of
       equally-named  remote  queues  will  be performed. If a printer matches in both categories the match to the manually defined
       cluster has priority. Automatic clustering of equally-named remote printers is not performed if there is a manually  defined
       cluster with this name (at least as the printers do not match this cluster).

       Examples:

       To  cluster all remote CUPS queues named "laserprinter" in your local network but not cluster any other equally-named remote
       CUPS printers use (Local queue will get named "laserprinter"):

               AutoClustering No
               Cluster laserprinter

       To cluster all remote CUPS queues of HP LaserJet 4050 printers in a local queue named "LJ4050":

               Cluster LJ4050: HP_LaserJet_4050

       As DNS-SD service names are unique in a network you can create a cluster from exactly specified printers (spaces replaced by
       underscores):

               Cluster hrdep: oldlaser_@_hr-server1 newlaser_@_hr-server2

       The  LoadBalancing  directive  switches  between  two methods of handling load balancing between equally-named remote queues
       which are represented by one local print queue making up a cluster of them (implicit class).

       The two methods are:

       Queuing of jobs on the client (LoadBalancing QueueOnClient):

       Here we queue up the jobs on the client and regularly check the clustered remote print queues. If we find an idle queue,  we
       pass on a job to it.

       This  is  also  the  method  which  CUPS  uses for classes. Advantage is a more even distribution of the job workload on the
       servers (especially if the printing speed of the servers is very different), and if a server fails, there  are  not  several
       jobs  stuck  or  lost.  Disadvantage  is  that if one takes the client (laptop, mobile phone, ...) out of the local network,
       printing stops with the jobs waiting in the local queue.

       Queuing of jobs on the servers (LoadBalancing QueueOnServers):

       Here we check the number of jobs on each of the clustered remote printers and send an incoming job immediately to the remote
       printer with the lowest amount of jobs in its queue. This way no jobs queue up locally, all jobs which are waiting are wait‐
       ing on one of the remote servers.

       Not having jobs waiting locally has the advantage that we can take the local machine from  the  network  and  all  jobs  get
       printed.  Disadvantage is that if a server with a full queue of jobs goes away, the jobs go away, too.

       Default is queuing the jobs on the client as this is what CUPS does with classes.

               LoadBalancing QueueOnServers

       With  the  DefaultOptions directive one or more option settings can be defined to be applied to every print queue newly cre‐
       ated by cups-browsed. Each option is supplied as one supplies options with the "-o" command line argument to  the  "lpadmin"
       command  (Run "man lpadmin" for more details). More than one option can be supplied separating the options by spaces. By de‐
       fault no option settings are pre-defined.

       Note that print queues which cups-browsed already created before remember their previous settings and so these  settings  do
       not get applied.

               DefaultOptions Option1=Value1 Option2=Value2 Option3 noOption4

       The AutoShutdown directive specifies whether cups-browsed should automatically terminate when it has no local raw queues set
       up pointing to any discovered remote printers or no jobs on such queues depending on AutoShutdownOn setting  (auto  shutdown
       mode).  Setting  it  to "On" activates the auto-shutdown mode, setting it to "Off" deactivates it (the default). The special
       mode "avahi" turns auto shutdown off while avahi-daemon is running and on when avahi-daemon stops. This allows running cups-
       browsed on-demand when avahi-daemon is run on-demand.

               AutoShutdown Off
               AutoShutdown On
               AutoShutdown avahi

       The  AutoShutdownOn  directive  determines what event cups-browsed considers as inactivity in auto shutdown mode. "NoQueues"
       (the default) means that auto shutdown is initiated when there are no queues for discovered  remote  printers  generated  by
       cups-browsed any more. "NoJobs" means that all queues generated by cups-browsed are without jobs.

               AutoShutdownOn NoQueues
               AutoShutdownOn NoJobs

       DebugLogFileSize  defines  the  maximum size possible (in KBytes) of the log files (cups-browsed_log and cups-browsed_previ‐
       ous_logs) that is created using cups-browsed in the debugging mode.  Setting its value to 0 would turn off  any  restriction
       on the size of the file.

               DebugLogFileSize 300

       The  AutoShutdownTimeout  directive specifies after how many seconds without local raw queues set up pointing to any discov‐
       ered remote printers or jobs on these queues cups-browsed should actually shut down in auto shutdown  mode.  Default  is  30
       seconds, 0 means immediate shutdown.

               AutoShutdownTimeout 20

       NotifLeaseDuration  defines  how long the D-BUS subscription created by cups-browsed in cupsd will last before cupsd cancels
       it. The default value is 1 day in seconds - 86400. The subscription renewal is set to happen after half  of  NotifLeaseDura‐
       tion  passed. The D-BUS notifications are used for watching over queues and doing specific actions when a D-BUS notification
       comes.

               NotifLeaseDuration 86400
       FrequentNetifUpdate turns on/off the network interface update routines which happen for each found entry, which can slow  up
       cups-browsed  significantly  if  we are on a network with many shared printers or if we use BrowsePoll to a server with many
       queues. Network interface updates after receiving D-BUS notification from NetworkManager won't be turned off with the direc‐
       tive. The default value is 'Yes'.

               FrequentNetifUpdate Yes
