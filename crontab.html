<pre>CRONTAB(1)                                            General Commands Manual                                            CRONTAB(1)

NAME
       crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (Vixie Cron)

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [ -u user ] file
       crontab [ -u user ] [ -i ] { -e | -l | -r }

DESCRIPTION
       crontab  is  the program used to install, deinstall or list the tables used to drive the cron(8) daemon in Vixie Cron.  Each
       user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be  edited
       directly.

       If  the  /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this
       command.  If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed  in
       the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command.

       If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be al‐
       lowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command.

       If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence.  Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your  user
       must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab.

       Regardless  of  the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab.  For
       standard Debian systems, all users may use this command.

       If the -u option is given, it specifies the name of the user whose crontab is to be used (when listing)  or  modified  (when
       editing).   If this option is not given, crontab examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the com‐
       mand.  Note that su(8) can confuse crontab and that if you are running inside of su(8) you should always use the  -u  option
       for safety's sake.

       The  first  form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some named file or standard input if the pseudo-file‐
       name ``-'' is given.

       The -l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard output.  See the note under DEBIAN SPECIFIC below.

       The -r option causes the current crontab to be removed.

       The -e option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment  variables.
       After  you  exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automatically.  If neither of the environment vari‐
       ables is defined, then the default editor /usr/bin/editor is used.

       The -i option modifies the -r option to prompt the user for a 'y/Y' response before actually removing the crontab.

DEBIAN SPECIFIC
       The "out-of-the-box" behaviour for crontab -l is to display the three line "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" header that is placed  at
       the beginning of the crontab when it is installed.  The problem is that it makes the sequence

       crontab -l | crontab -

       non-idempotent  — you keep adding copies of the header.  This causes pain to scripts that use sed to edit a crontab.  There‐
       fore, the default behaviour of the -l option has been changed to not output such header.  You may obtain the original behav‐
       iour by setting the environment variable CRONTAB_NOHEADER to 'N', which will cause the crontab -l command to emit the extra‐
       neous header.

       crontab(5), cron(8)

FILES
       /etc/cron.allow
       /etc/cron.deny
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs

       The files /etc/cron.allow and  /etc/cron.deny  if,  they  exist,  must  be  either  world-readable,  or  readable  by  group
       ``crontab''. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed.

       There  is  one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory.  Users are not allowed to edit the
       files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them,  and
       only  syntactically  correct  crontabs will be written there.  This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the
       crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group.

STANDARDS
       The crontab command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').  This new command syntax differs from previous versions  of
       Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad command line.

       cron  requires  that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character.  If the last entry in a crontab is missing the new‐
       line, cron will consider the crontab (at least partially) broken and refuse to install it.

       The files under /var/spool/cron/crontabs are named based on the user's account name.  Crontab jobs will not be run for users
       whose  accounts  have  been  renamed either due to changes in the local system or because they are managed through a central
       user database (external to the system, for example an LDAP directory).
