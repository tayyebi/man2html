NAME
       e2undo - Replay an undo log for an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system

SYNOPSIS
       e2undo [ -f ] [ -h ] [ -n ] [ -o offset ] [ -v ] [ -z undo_file ] undo_log device

DESCRIPTION
       e2undo  will  replay  the  undo  log undo_log for an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system found on device.  This can be used to undo a
       failed operation by an e2fsprogs program.

OPTIONS
       -f     Normally, e2undo will check the file system superblock to make sure the undo log matches with the file system on  the
              device.   If  they  do not match, e2undo will refuse to apply the undo log as a safety mechanism.  The -f option dis‚Äê
              ables this safety mechanism.

       -h     Display a usage message.

       -n     Dry-run; do not actually write blocks back to the file system.

       -o offset
              Specify the file system's offset (in bytes) from the beginning of the device or file.

       -v     Report which block we're currently replaying.

       -z undo_file
              Before overwriting a file system block, write the old contents of the block to an undo file.  This undo file  can  be
              used with e2undo(8) to restore the old contents of the file system should something go wrong.  If the empty string is
              passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file will be written to a file named e2undo-device.e2undo in the directory
              specified via the E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR environment variable.

              WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a power or system crash.
