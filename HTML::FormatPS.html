<pre>HTML::FormatPS(3pm)                             User Contributed Perl Documentation                             HTML::FormatPS(3pm)

NAME
       HTML::FormatPS - Format HTML as PostScript

VERSION
       version 2.16

SYNOPSIS
           use HTML::TreeBuilder;
           $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new-&gt;parse_file("test.html");

           use HTML::FormatPS;
           $formatter = HTML::FormatPS-&gt;new(
               FontFamily =&gt; 'Helvetica',
               PaperSize  =&gt; 'Letter',
           );
           print $formatter-&gt;format($tree);

       Or, for short:

           use HTML::FormatPS;
           print HTML::FormatPS-&gt;format_file(
               "test.html",
               'FontFamily' =&gt; 'Helvetica',
               'PaperSize'  =&gt; 'Letter',
           );

DESCRIPTION
       The HTML::FormatPS is a formatter that outputs PostScript code. Formatting of HTML tables and forms is not implemented.

       HTML::FormatPS is built on top of HTML::Formatter and so further detail may be found in the documentation for
       HTML::Formatter.

       You might specify the following parameters when constructing the formatter object (or when calling format_file or
       format_string):

       PaperSize
           What kind of paper should we format for.  The value can be one of these: A3, A4, A5, B4, B5, Letter, Legal, Executive,
           Tabloid, Statement, Folio, 10x14, Quarto.

           The default is "A4".

       PaperWidth
           The width of the paper, in points.  Setting PaperSize also defines this value.

       PaperHeight
           The height of the paper, in points.  Setting PaperSize also defines this value.

       LeftMargin
           The left margin, in points.

       RightMargin
           The right margin, in points.

       HorizontalMargin
           Both left and right margin at the same time.  The default value is 4 cm.

       TopMargin
           The top margin, in points.

       BottomMargin
           The bottom margin, in points.

       VerticalMargin
           Both top and bottom margin at the same time.  The default value is 2 cm,

       PageNo
           This parameter determines if we should put page numbers on the pages. The default value is true; so you have to set this
           value to 0 in order to suppress page numbers.  (The "No" in "PageNo" means number/numero!)

       FontFamily
           This parameter specifies which family of fonts to use for the formatting. Legal values are "Courier", "Helvetica" and
           "Times".  The default is "Times".

       FontScale
           This is a scaling factor for all the font sizes.  The default value is 1.

           For example, if you want everything to be almost three times as large, you could set this to 2.7.  If you wanted things
           just a bit smaller than normal, you could set it to .92.

       Leading
           This option (pronounced "ledding", not "leeding") controls how much is space between lines. This is a factor of the font
           size used for that line.  Default is 0.1 -- so between two 12-point lines, there will be 1.2 points of space.

       StartPage
           Assuming you have PageNo on, StartPage controls what the page number of the first page will be. By default, it is 1. So
           if you set this to 87, the first page would say "87" on it, the next "88", and so on.

       NoProlog
           If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatPS will make a point of not emitting the PostScript prolog before the
           document. By default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatPS will emit the prolog. This option is of interest only to
           advanced users.

       NoTrailer
           If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatPS will make a point of not emitting the PostScript trailer at the
           end of the document. By default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatPS will emit the bit of PostScript that ends the
           document. This option is of interest only to advanced users.

METHODS
   new
           my $formatter = FormatterClass-&gt;new(
               option1 =&gt; value1, option2 =&gt; value2, ...
           );

       This creates a new formatter object with the given options.

SEE ALSO
       HTML::Formatter

ISSUES
       •   Output is in ISO Latin1 format. The underlying HTML parsers tend to now work in Unicode (perl native) code points. There
           is an impedance mismatch between these, which may give issues with complex characters within HTML.

TO DO
       •   Support for some more character styles, notably including: strike-through, underlining, superscript, and subscript.

       •   Support for Unicode.

       •   Support for Win-1252 encoding, since that's what most people mean when they use characters in the range 0x80-0x9F in
           HTML.

       •   And, if it's ever even reasonably possible, support for tables.

       I would welcome email from people who can help me out or advise me on the above.
