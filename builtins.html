NAME
       bash-builtins - bash built-in commands, see bash(1)

SYNOPSIS
       bash  defines  the  following  built-in commands: :, ., [, alias, bg, bind, break, builtin, case, cd, command, compgen, com‐
       plete, continue, declare, dirs, disown, echo, enable, eval, exec, exit, export, fc, fg, getopts, hash,  help,  history,  if,
       jobs,  kill, let, local, logout, popd, printf, pushd, pwd, read, readonly, return, set, shift, shopt, source, suspend, test,
       times, trap, type, typeset, ulimit, umask, unalias, unset, until, wait, while.

BASH BUILTIN COMMANDS
       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by  -  accepts  --  to
       signify  the  end  of  the  options.  The :, true, false, and test/[ builtins do not accept options and do not treat -- spe‐
       cially.  The exit, logout, return, break, continue, let, and shift builtins accept and process arguments  beginning  with  -
       without  requiring  --.  Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments
       beginning with - as invalid options and require -- to prevent this interpretation.
       : [arguments]
              No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments and performing any specified redirections.  The return
              status is zero.

        .  filename [arguments]
       source filename [arguments]
              Read  and execute commands from filename in the current shell environment and return the exit status of the last com‐
              mand executed from filename.  If filename does not contain a slash, filenames in PATH are used to find the  directory
              containing  filename,  but  filename  does not need to be executable.  The file searched for in PATH need not be exe‐
              cutable.  When bash is not in posix mode, it searches the current directory if no file is  found  in  PATH.   If  the
              sourcepath  option  to  the shopt builtin command is turned off, the PATH is not searched.  If any arguments are sup‐
              plied, they become the positional parameters when filename is executed.  Otherwise the positional parameters are  un‐
              changed.  If the -T option is enabled, . inherits any trap on DEBUG; if it is not, any DEBUG trap string is saved and
              restored around the call to ., and . unsets the DEBUG trap while it executes.  If -T is not set, and the sourced file
              changes the DEBUG trap, the new value is retained when . completes.  The return status is the status of the last com‐
              mand exited within the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if filename is not found or cannot be read.

       alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]
              Alias with no arguments or with the -p option prints the list of aliases in the form  alias  name=value  on  standard
              output.   When  arguments  are supplied, an alias is defined for each name whose value is given.  A trailing space in
              value causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.  For each name in the ar‐
              gument  list for which no value is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.  Alias returns true unless a
              name is given for which no alias has been defined.

       bg [jobspec ...]
              Resume each suspended job jobspec in the background, as if it had been started with &amp;.  If jobspec  is  not  present,
              the shell's notion of the current job is used.  bg jobspec returns 0 unless run when job control is disabled or, when
              run with job control enabled, any specified jobspec was not found or was started without job control.

       bind [-m keymap] [-lpsvPSVX]
       bind [-m keymap] [-q function] [-u function] [-r keyseq]
       bind [-m keymap] -f filename
       bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq:shell-command
       bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name
       bind [-m keymap] keyseq:readline-command
       bind readline-command-line
              Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a readline function or  macro,  or  set  a
              readline  variable.   Each non-option argument is a command as it would appear in a readline initialization file such
              as  .inputrc,  but  each  binding  or  command  must  be  passed  as  a   separate   argument;   e.g.,   '"\C-x\C-r":
              re-read-init-file'.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -m keymap
                     Use  keymap  as  the  keymap  to  be  affected by the subsequent bindings.  Acceptable keymap names are emacs,
                     emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert.  vi is equivalent  to  vi-com‐
                     mand (vi-move is also a synonym); emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.
              -l     List the names of all readline functions.
              -p     Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.
              -P     List current readline function names and bindings.
              -s     Display  readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in such a way that they can be re-
                     read.
              -S     Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.
              -v     Display readline variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.
              -V     List current readline variable names and values.
              -f filename
                     Read key bindings from filename.
              -q function
                     Query about which keys invoke the named function.
              -u function
                     Unbind all keys bound to the named function.
              -r keyseq
                     Remove any current binding for keyseq.
              -x keyseq:shell-command
                     Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.  When shell-command is executed, the shell sets
                     the  READLINE_LINE  variable  to  the  contents  of  the readline line buffer and the READLINE_POINT and READ‐
                     LINE_MARK variables to the current location of the insertion point and the saved insertion point  (the  mark),
                     respectively.  The shell assigns any numeric argument the user supplied to the READLINE_ARGUMENT variable.  If
                     there was no argument, that variable is not set.  If the executed command changes the value of  any  of  READ‐
                     LINE_LINE, READLINE_POINT, or READLINE_MARK, those new values will be reflected in the editing state.
              -X     List  all  key sequences bound to shell commands and the associated commands in a format that can be reused as
                     input.

              The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.

       break [n]
              Exit from within a for, while, until, or select loop.  If n is specified, break n levels.  n must be ≥ 1.   If  n  is
              greater  than  the  number of enclosing loops, all enclosing loops are exited.  The return value is 0 unless n is not
              greater than or equal to 1.

       builtin shell-builtin [arguments]
              Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it arguments, and return its exit status.  This is useful when  defining
              a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the functionality of the builtin within the function.
              The cd builtin is commonly redefined this way.  The return status is false if shell-builtin is not  a  shell  builtin
              command.

       caller [expr]
              Returns  the  context  of  any  active  subroutine  call  (a shell function or a script executed with the . or source
              builtins).  Without expr, caller displays the line number and source filename of the current subroutine call.   If  a
              non-negative  integer  is  supplied as expr, caller displays the line number, subroutine name, and source file corre‐
              sponding to that position in the current execution call stack.  This extra information may be used, for  example,  to
              print  a  stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.  The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a sub‐
              routine call or expr does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.

       cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
              Change the current directory to dir.  if dir is not supplied, the value of the HOME shell variable  is  the  default.
              The  variable  CDPATH  defines  the  search  path  for the directory containing dir: each directory name in CDPATH is
              searched for dir.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in  CD‐
              PATH  is  the  same  as the current directory, i.e., ``.''.  If dir begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
              The -P option causes cd to use the physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing dir  and
              before  processing  instances  of .. in dir (see also the -P option to the set builtin command); the -L option forces
              symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of .. in dir.  If .. appears  in  dir,
              it is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component from dir, back to a slash or the beginning of
              dir.  If the -e option is supplied with -P, and the current working directory cannot be successfully determined after
              a  successful  directory  change,  cd  will return an unsuccessful status.  On systems that support it, the -@ option
              presents the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory.  An argument of - is converted to $OLDPWD be‐
              fore  the directory change is attempted.  If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if - is the first ar‐
              gument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to  the
              standard output.  If the directory change is successful, cd sets the value of the PWD environment variable to the new
              directory name, and sets the OLDPWD environment variable to the value of the current  working  directory  before  the
              change.  The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.

       command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
              Run  command  with args suppressing the normal shell function lookup.  Only builtin commands or commands found in the
              PATH are executed.  If the -p option is given, the search for command is performed using a  default  value  for  PATH
              that  is  guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.  If either the -V or -v option is supplied, a description
              of command is printed.  The -v option causes a single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke  command
              to  be  displayed;  the  -V option produces a more verbose description.  If the -V or -v option is supplied, the exit
              status is 0 if command was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or command  can‐
              not  be  found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status of the command builtin is the exit status of com‐
              mand.

       compgen [option] [word]
              Generate possible completion matches for word according to the options, which may be any option accepted by the  com‐
              plete builtin with the exception of -p and -r, and write the matches to the standard output.  When using the -F or -C
              options, the various shell variables set by the programmable completion facilities, while available,  will  not  have
              useful values.

              The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had generated them directly from
              a completion specification with the same flags.  If word is specified, only those completions matching word  will  be
              displayed.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were generated.

       complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o comp-option] [-DEI] [-A action] [-G globpat] [-W wordlist]
              [-F function] [-C command] [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] name [name ...]
       complete -pr [-DEI] [name ...]
              Specify how arguments to each name should be completed.  If the -p option is supplied, or if no options are supplied,
              existing completion specifications are printed in a way that allows them to be reused as input.  The  -r  option  re‐
              moves  a completion specification for each name, or, if no names are supplied, all completion specifications.  The -D
              option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to the ``default'' command completion; that is,
              completion  attempted on a command for which no completion has previously been defined.  The -E option indicates that
              other supplied options and actions should apply to ``empty'' command completion; that is, completion attempted  on  a
              blank  line.   The -I option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to completion on the ini‐
              tial non-assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as ; or |, which is usually command name com‐
              pletion.  If multiple options are supplied, the -D option takes precedence over -E, and both take precedence over -I.
              If any of -D, -E, or -I are supplied, any other name arguments are ignored; these completions only apply to the  case
              specified by the option.

              The process of applying these completion specifications when word completion is attempted is described in bash(1).

              Other  options, if specified, have the following meanings.  The arguments to the -G, -W, and -X options (and, if nec‐
              essary, the -P and -S options) should be quoted to protect them from expansion before the  complete  builtin  is  in‐
              voked.
              -o comp-option
                      The  comp-option  controls several aspects of the compspec's behavior beyond the simple generation of comple‐
                      tions.  comp-option may be one of:
                      bashdefault
                              Perform the rest of the default bash completions if the compspec generates no matches.
                      default Use readline's default filename completion if the compspec generates no matches.
                      dirnames
                              Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates no matches.
                      filenames
                              Tell readline that the compspec generates filenames, so it can perform any filename-specific process‐
                              ing (like adding a slash to directory names, quoting special characters, or suppressing trailing spa‐
                              ces).  Intended to be used with shell functions.
                      noquote Tell readline not to quote the completed words if they are filenames (quoting filenames  is  the  de‐
                              fault).
                      nosort  Tell readline not to sort the list of possible completions alphabetically.
                      nospace Tell readline not to append a space (the default) to words completed at the end of the line.
                      plusdirs
                              After  any  matches defined by the compspec are generated, directory name completion is attempted and
                              any matches are added to the results of the other actions.
              -A action
                      The action may be one of the following to generate a list of possible completions:
                      alias   Alias names.  May also be specified as -a.
                      arrayvar
                              Array variable names.
                      binding Readline key binding names.
                      builtin Names of shell builtin commands.  May also be specified as -b.
                      command Command names.  May also be specified as -c.
                      directory
                              Directory names.  May also be specified as -d.
                      disabled
                              Names of disabled shell builtins.
                      enabled Names of enabled shell builtins.
                      export  Names of exported shell variables.  May also be specified as -e.
                      file    File names.  May also be specified as -f.
                      function
                              Names of shell functions.
                      group   Group names.  May also be specified as -g.
                      helptopic
                              Help topics as accepted by the help builtin.
                      hostname
                              Hostnames, as taken from the file specified by the HOSTFILE shell variable.
                      job     Job names, if job control is active.  May also be specified as -j.
                      keyword Shell reserved words.  May also be specified as -k.
                      running Names of running jobs, if job control is active.
                      service Service names.  May also be specified as -s.
                      setopt  Valid arguments for the -o option to the set builtin.
                      shopt   Shell option names as accepted by the shopt builtin.
                      signal  Signal names.
                      stopped Names of stopped jobs, if job control is active.
                      user    User names.  May also be specified as -u.
                      variable
                              Names of all shell variables.  May also be specified as -v.
              -C command
                      command is executed in a subshell environment, and its output is used as the possible completions.  Arguments
                      are passed as with the -F option.
              -F function
                      The shell function function is executed in the current shell environment.  When the function is executed, the
                      first argument ($1) is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument  ($2)
                      is  the  word  being completed, and the third argument ($3) is the word preceding the word being completed on
                      the current command line.  When it finishes, the possible completions are retrieved from  the  value  of  the
                      COMPREPLY array variable.
              -G globpat
                      The pathname expansion pattern globpat is expanded to generate the possible completions.
              -P prefix
                      prefix is added at the beginning of each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
              -S suffix
                      suffix is appended to each possible completion after all other options have been applied.
              -W wordlist
                      The wordlist is split using the characters in the IFS special variable as delimiters, and each resultant word
                      is expanded.  Shell quoting is honored within wordlist, in order to provide a mechanism for the words to con‐
                      tain shell metacharacters or characters in the value of IFS.  The possible completions are the members of the
                      resultant list which match the word being completed.
              -X filterpat
                      filterpat is a pattern as used for pathname expansion.  It is applied to the  list  of  possible  completions
                      generated  by the preceding options and arguments, and each completion matching filterpat is removed from the
                      list.  A leading ! in filterpat negates the pattern; in this case, any completion not matching  filterpat  is
                      removed.

              The  return  value  is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an option other than -p or -r is supplied without a
              name argument, an attempt is made to remove a completion specification for a name for which no specification  exists,
              or an error occurs adding a completion specification.

       compopt [-o option] [-DEI] [+o option] [name]
              Modify  completion  options  for  each name according to the options, or for the currently-executing completion if no
              names are supplied.  If no options are given, display the completion options for each name or the current completion.
              The possible values of option are those valid for the complete builtin described above.  The -D option indicates that
              other supplied options should apply to the ``default'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a command
              for  which no completion has previously been defined.  The -E option indicates that other supplied options should ap‐
              ply to ``empty'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line.  The  -I  option  indicates  that
              other  supplied options should apply to completion on the initial non-assignment word on the line, or after a command
              delimiter such as ; or |, which is usually command name completion.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an attempt is made to modify the options  for  a  name
              for which no completion specification exists, or an output error occurs.

       continue [n]
              Resume  the  next iteration of the enclosing for, while, until, or select loop.  If n is specified, resume at the nth
              enclosing loop.  n must be ≥ 1.  If n is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the  last  enclosing  loop  (the
              ``top-level'' loop) is resumed.  The return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.

       declare [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]
       typeset [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]
              Declare  variables  and/or give them attributes.  If no names are given then display the values of variables.  The -p
              option will display the attributes and values of each name.  When -p is used with name arguments, additional options,
              other  than  -f  and -F, are ignored.  When -p is supplied without name arguments, it will display the attributes and
              values of all variables having the attributes specified by the additional options.  If no other options are  supplied
              with -p, declare will display the attributes and values of all shell variables.  The -f option will restrict the dis‐
              play to shell functions.  The -F option inhibits the display of function definitions; only the function name and  at‐
              tributes  are  printed.   If  the  extdebug shell option is enabled using shopt, the source file name and line number
              where each name is defined are displayed as well.  The -F option implies -f.  The -g option forces  variables  to  be
              created  or  modified  at  the global scope, even when declare is executed in a shell function.  It is ignored in all
              other cases.  The -I option causes local variables to inherit the attributes (except the nameref attribute) and value
              of  any  existing  variable  with  the same name at a surrounding scope.  If there is no existing variable, the local
              variable is initially unset.  The following options can be used to restrict output to variables  with  the  specified
              attribute or to give variables attributes:
              -a     Each name is an indexed array variable (see Arrays in bash(1)).
              -A     Each name is an associative array variable (see Arrays in bash(1)).
              -f     Use function names only.
              -i     The  variable  is  treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION in bash(1)) is per‐
                     formed when the variable is assigned a value.
              -l     When the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case characters are converted to lower-case.  The  upper-case
                     attribute is disabled.
              -n     Give  each name the nameref attribute, making it a name reference to another variable.  That other variable is
                     defined by the value of name.  All references, assignments, and attribute modifications to name, except  those
                     using  or  changing  the  -n  attribute itself, are performed on the variable referenced by name's value.  The
                     nameref attribute cannot be applied to array variables.
              -r     Make names readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned values by subsequent assignment statements or unset.
              -t     Give each name the trace attribute.  Traced functions inherit the DEBUG and  RETURN  traps  from  the  calling
                     shell.  The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
              -u     When  the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.  The lower-case
                     attribute is disabled.
              -x     Mark names for export to subsequent commands via the environment.

              Using `+' instead of `-' turns off the attribute instead, with the exceptions that +a and +A may not be used  to  de‐
              stroy  array  variables  and +r will not remove the readonly attribute.  When used in a function, declare and typeset
              make each name local, as with the local command, unless the -g option is supplied.  If a variable name is followed by
              =value,  the value of the variable is set to value.  When using -a or -A and the compound assignment syntax to create
              array variables, additional attributes do not take effect until subsequent assignments.  The return value is 0 unless
              an invalid option is encountered, an attempt is made to define a function using ``-f foo=bar'', an attempt is made to
              assign a value to a readonly variable, an attempt is made to assign a value to an array variable  without  using  the
              compound  assignment  syntax (see Arrays in bash(1)), one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, an attempt
              is made to turn off readonly status for a readonly variable, an attempt is made to turn off array status for an array
              variable, or an attempt is made to display a non-existent function with -f.

       dirs [-clpv] [+n] [-n]
              Without options, displays the list of currently remembered directories.  The default display is on a single line with
              directory names separated by spaces.  Directories are added to the list with the pushd command; the popd command  re‐
              moves entries from the list.  The current directory is always the first directory in the stack.
              -c     Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.
              -l     Produces a listing using full pathnames; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.
              -p     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
              -v     Print the directory stack with one entry per line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.
              +n     Displays the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting
                     with zero.
              -n     Displays the nth entry counting from the right of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options,  start‐
                     ing with zero.

              The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is supplied or n indexes beyond the end of the directory stack.

       disown [-ar] [-h] [jobspec ... | pid ... ]
              Without  options,  remove  each jobspec from the table of active jobs.  If jobspec is not present, and neither the -a
              nor the -r option is supplied, the current job is used.  If the -h option is given, each jobspec is not removed  from
              the table, but is marked so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the shell receives a SIGHUP.  If no jobspec is sup‐
              plied, the -a option means to remove or mark all jobs; the -r option without a jobspec argument  restricts  operation
              to running jobs.  The return value is 0 unless a jobspec does not specify a valid job.

       echo [-neE] [arg ...]
              Output the args, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.  The return status is 0 unless a write error occurs.  If
              -n is specified, the trailing newline is suppressed.  If the -e option is  given,  interpretation  of  the  following
              backslash-escaped  characters is enabled.  The -E option disables the interpretation of these escape characters, even
              on systems where they are interpreted by default.  The xpg_echo shell option may be  used  to  dynamically  determine
              whether  or  not  echo expands these escape characters by default.  echo does not interpret -- to mean the end of op‐
              tions.  echo interprets the following escape sequences:
              \a     alert (bell)
              \b     backspace
              \c     suppress further output
              \e
              \E     an escape character
              \f     form feed
              \n     new line
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \\     backslash
              \0nnn  the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (zero to three octal digits)
              \xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)
              \uHHHH the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)
              \UHHHHHHHH
                     the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)

       enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f filename] [name ...]
              Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same  name  as  a
              shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally searches for builtins
              before disk commands.  If -n is used, each name is disabled; otherwise, names are enabled.  For example, to  use  the
              test  binary found via the PATH instead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''.  The -f option means to
              load the new builtin command name from shared object filename, on systems that support dynamic  loading.   Bash  will
              use  the  value  of  the BASH_LOADABLES_PATH variable as a colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
              filename.  The default is system-dependent.  The -d option will delete a builtin previously loaded with  -f.   If  no
              name arguments are given, or if the -p option is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed.  With no other option
              arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins.  If -n is supplied, only disabled builtins  are  printed.
              If  -a is supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled.  If
              -s is supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX special builtins.  If no options are supplied and a name is not
              a shell builtin, enable will attempt to load name from a shared object named name, as if the command were ``enable -f
              name name .  The return value is 0 unless a name is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading  a  new  builtin
              from a shared object.

       eval [arg ...]
              The  args  are  read  and concatenated together into a single command.  This command is then read and executed by the
              shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of eval.  If there are no args, or only null arguments, eval  re‐
              turns 0.

       exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]
              If  command  is  specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process is created.  The arguments become the arguments to
              command.  If the -l option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the  zeroth  argument  passed  to
              command.   This is what login(1) does.  The -c option causes command to be executed with an empty environment.  If -a
              is supplied, the shell passes name as the zeroth argument to the executed command.  If command cannot be executed for
              some  reason,  a  non-interactive shell exits, unless the execfail shell option is enabled.  In that case, it returns
              failure.  An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed.  A subshell exits  unconditionally  if
              exec fails.  If command is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is
              0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.

       exit [n]
              Cause the shell to exit with a status of n.  If n is omitted, the exit status is that of the last  command  executed.
              A trap on EXIT is executed before the shell terminates.

       export [-fn] [name[=word]] ...
       export -p
              The  supplied  names are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If the -f
              option is given, the names refer to functions.  If no names are given, or if the -p option is  supplied,  a  list  of
              names  of  all exported variables is printed.  The -n option causes the export property to be removed from each name.
              If a variable name is followed by =word, the value of the variable is set to word.  export returns an exit status  of
              0  unless  an  invalid  option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied
              with a name that is not a function.

       fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last]
       fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]
              The first form selects a range of commands from first to last from the history list and displays or edits and re-exe‐
              cutes  them.   First and last may be specified as a string (to locate the last command beginning with that string) or
              as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from  the  current  command
              number).  When listing, a first or last of 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is equivalent to the current command (usually
              the fc command); otherwise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.  If last is not specified, it is set to the  cur‐
              rent command for listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to first otherwise.  If first is not
              specified, it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing.

              The -n option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The -r option reverses the order of the commands.  If the
              -l option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor given by ename is invoked on a
              file containing those commands.  If ename is not given, the value of the FCEDIT variable is used, and  the  value  of
              EDITOR  if FCEDIT is not set.  If neither variable is set, vi is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands
              are echoed and executed.

              In the second form, command is re-executed after each instance of pat is replaced by rep.  Command is interpreted the
              same as first above.  A useful alias to use with this is ``r="fc -s"'', so that typing ``r cc'' runs the last command
              beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.

              If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or  first  or  last  specify
              history lines out of range.  If the -e option is supplied, the return value is the value of the last command executed
              or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the second form is used, the return status  is
              that of the command re-executed, unless cmd does not specify a valid history line, in which case fc returns failure.

       fg [jobspec]
              Resume  jobspec in the foreground, and make it the current job.  If jobspec is not present, the shell's notion of the
              current job is used.  The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground, or failure if run when  job
              control  is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if jobspec does not specify a valid job or jobspec speci‐
              fies a job that was started without job control.

       getopts optstring name [arg ...]
              getopts is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.  optstring contains the option characters  to  be
              recognized;  if a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be sepa‐
              rated from it by white space.  The colon and question mark characters may not be used  as  option  characters.   Each
              time  it  is invoked, getopts places the next option in the shell variable name, initializing name if it does not ex‐
              ist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable OPTIND.  OPTIND is initialized  to  1  each
              time  the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an argument, getopts places that argument into
              the variable OPTARG.  The shell does not reset OPTIND automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls
              to getopts within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.

              When  the  end  of options is encountered, getopts exits with a return value greater than zero.  OPTIND is set to the
              index of the first non-option argument, and name is set to ?.

              getopts normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are supplied as arg values,  getopts  parses
              those instead.

              getopts  can  report  errors  in two ways.  If the first character of optstring is a colon, silent error reporting is
              used.  In normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed when invalid options or missing option arguments are  en‐
              countered.   If  the variable OPTERR is set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if the first character of
              optstring is not a colon.

              If an invalid option is seen, getopts places ? into name and, if not silent, prints an error message and  unsets  OP‐
              TARG.  If getopts is silent, the option character found is placed in OPTARG and no diagnostic message is printed.

              If  a required argument is not found, and getopts is not silent, a question mark (?) is placed in name, OPTARG is un‐
              set, and a diagnostic message is printed.  If getopts is silent, then a colon (:) is placed in name and OPTARG is set
              to the option character found.

              getopts returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns false if the end of options is en‐
              countered or an error occurs.

       hash [-lr] [-p filename] [-dt] [name]
              Each time hash is invoked, the full pathname of the command name is determined by searching the directories in  $PATH
              and  remembered.   Any  previously-remembered pathname is discarded.  If the -p option is supplied, no path search is
              performed, and filename is used as the full filename of the command.  The -r option causes the shell  to  forget  all
              remembered  locations.  The -d option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of each name.  If the -t op‐
              tion is supplied, the full pathname to which each name corresponds is printed.  If multiple name arguments  are  sup‐
              plied with -t, the name is printed before the hashed full pathname.  The -l option causes output to be displayed in a
              format that may be reused as input.  If no arguments are given, or if only -l is supplied, information  about  remem‐
              bered commands is printed.  The return status is true unless a name is not found or an invalid option is supplied.

       help [-dms] [pattern]
              Display  helpful  information  about builtin commands.  If pattern is specified, help gives detailed help on all com‐
              mands matching pattern; otherwise help for all the builtins and shell control structures is printed.
              -d     Display a short description of each pattern
              -m     Display the description of each pattern in a manpage-like format
              -s     Display only a short usage synopsis for each pattern

              The return status is 0 unless no command matches pattern.

       history [n]
       history -c
       history -d offset
       history -d start-end
       history -anrw [filename]
       history -p arg [arg ...]
       history -s arg [arg ...]
              With no options, display the command history list with line numbers.  Lines listed with a * have been  modified.   An
              argument of n lists only the last n lines.  If the shell variable HISTTIMEFORMAT is set and not null, it is used as a
              format string for strftime(3) to display the time stamp associated with each displayed history entry.  No intervening
              blank  is  printed between the formatted time stamp and the history line.  If filename is supplied, it is used as the
              name of the history file; if not, the value of HISTFILE is used.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -c     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.
              -d offset
                     Delete the history entry at position offset.  If offset is negative, it is  interpreted  as  relative  to  one
                     greater than the last history position, so negative indices count back from the end of the history, and an in‐
                     dex of -1 refers to the current history -d command.
              -d start-end
                     Delete the range of history entries between positions start and end, inclusive.  Positive and negative  values
                     for start and end are interpreted as described above.
              -a     Append  the ``new'' history lines to the history file.  These are history lines entered since the beginning of
                     the current bash session, but not already appended to the history file.
              -n     Read the history lines not already read from the history file into the current history list.  These are  lines
                     appended to the history file since the beginning of the current bash session.
              -r     Read the contents of the history file and append them to the current history list.
              -w     Write the current history list to the history file, overwriting the history file's contents.
              -p     Perform  history  substitution  on the following args and display the result on the standard output.  Does not
                     store the results in the history list.  Each arg must be quoted to disable normal history expansion.
              -s     Store the args in the history list as a single entry.  The last command in the history list is removed  before
                     the args are added.

              If  the  HISTTIMEFORMAT  variable is set, the time stamp information associated with each history entry is written to
              the history file, marked with the history comment character.  When the history file is read, lines beginning with the
              history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the following history en‐
              try.  The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while  reading  or  writing  the
              history  file,  an  invalid offset or range is supplied as an argument to -d, or the history expansion supplied as an
              argument to -p fails.

       jobs [-lnprs] [ jobspec ... ]
       jobs -x command [ args ... ]
              The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the following meanings:
              -l     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
              -n     Display information only about jobs that have changed status since the user was last notified of their status.
              -p     List only the process ID of the job's process group leader.
              -r     Display only running jobs.
              -s     Display only stopped jobs.

              If jobspec is given, output is restricted to information about that job.  The return status is 0  unless  an  invalid
              option is encountered or an invalid jobspec is supplied.

              If the -x option is supplied, jobs replaces any jobspec found in command or args with the corresponding process group
              ID, and executes command passing it args, returning its exit status.

       kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] [pid | jobspec] ...
       kill -l|-L [sigspec | exit_status]
              Send the signal named by sigspec or signum to the processes named by pid or jobspec.  sigspec is either a case-insen‐
              sitive  signal  name  such as SIGKILL (with or without the SIG prefix) or a signal number; signum is a signal number.
              If sigspec is not present, then SIGTERM is assumed.  An argument of -l lists the signal names.  If any arguments  are
              supplied  when -l is given, the names of the signals corresponding to the arguments are listed, and the return status
              is 0.  The exit_status argument to -l is a number specifying either a signal number or the exit status of  a  process
              terminated  by  a  signal.  The -L option is equivalent to -l.  kill returns true if at least one signal was success‐
              fully sent, or false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.

       let arg [arg ...]
              Each arg is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION in bash(1)).  If the last arg  evalu‐
              ates to 0, let returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.

       local [option] [name[=value] ... | - ]
              For  each argument, a local variable named name is created, and assigned value.  The option can be any of the options
              accepted by declare.  When local is used within a function, it causes the variable name to have a visible  scope  re‐
              stricted  to that function and its children.  If name is -, the set of shell options is made local to the function in
              which local is invoked: shell options changed using the set builtin inside the function are restored to their  origi‐
              nal  values  when  the function returns.  The restore is effected as if a series of set commands were executed to re‐
              store the values that were in place before the function.  With no operands, local writes a list of local variables to
              the standard output.  It is an error to use local when not within a function.  The return status is 0 unless local is
              used outside a function, an invalid name is supplied, or name is a readonly variable.

       mapfile [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
       readarray [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
              Read lines from the standard input into the indexed array variable array, or from file descriptor fd if the -u option
              is supplied.  The variable MAPFILE is the default array.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -d     The first character of delim is used to terminate each input line, rather than newline.  If delim is the empty
                     string, mapfile will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
              -n     Copy at most count lines.  If count is 0, all lines are copied.
              -O     Begin assigning to array at index origin.  The default index is 0.
              -s     Discard the first count lines read.
              -t     Remove a trailing delim (default newline) from each line read.
              -u     Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.
              -C     Evaluate callback each time quantum lines are read.  The -c option specifies quantum.
              -c     Specify the number of lines read between each call to callback.

              If -C is specified without -c, the default quantum is 5000.  When callback is evaluated, it is supplied the index  of
              the  next array element to be assigned and the line to be assigned to that element as additional arguments.  callback
              is evaluated after the line is read but before the array element is assigned.

              If not supplied with an explicit origin, mapfile will clear array before assigning to it.

              mapfile returns successfully unless  an  invalid  option  or  option  argument  is  supplied,  array  is  invalid  or
              unassignable, or if array is not an indexed array.

       popd [-n] [+n] [-n]
              Removes entries from the directory stack.  The elements are numbered from 0 starting at the first directory listed by
              dirs.  With no arguments, popd removes the top directory from the stack, and changes to the new top directory.  Argu‐
              ments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
              -n     Suppresses  the normal change of directory when removing directories from the stack, so that only the stack is
                     manipulated.
              +n     Removes the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero,  from  the  stack.
                     For example: ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd +1'' the second.
              -n     Removes  the  nth  entry  counting from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero.  For example:
                     ``popd -0'' removes the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next to last.

              If the top element of the directory stack is modified, and the -n option was not supplied, popd uses the  cd  builtin
              to change to the directory at the top of the stack.  If the cd fails, popd returns a non-zero value.

              Otherwise,  popd  returns  false if an invalid option is encountered, the directory stack is empty, or a non-existent
              directory stack entry is specified.

              If the popd command is successful, bash runs dirs to show the final contents of the directory stack, and  the  return
              status is 0.

       printf [-v var] format [arguments]
              Write  the formatted arguments to the standard output under the control of the format.  The -v option causes the out‐
              put to be assigned to the variable var rather than being printed to the standard output.

              The format is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied  to
              standard output, character escape sequences, which are converted and copied to the standard output, and format speci‐
              fications, each of which causes printing of the next successive argument.  In addition to the standard printf(1) for‐
              mat specifications, printf interprets the following extensions:
              %b     causes printf to expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding argument in the same way as echo -e.
              %q     causes printf to output the corresponding argument in a format that can be reused as shell input.
              %Q     like %q, but applies any supplied precision to the argument before quoting it.
              %(datefmt)T
                     causes  printf to output the date-time string resulting from using datefmt as a format string for strftime(3).
                     The corresponding argument is an integer representing the number of seconds since the epoch.  Two special  ar‐
                     gument  values  may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked.
                     If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been given.  This is an exception  to  the  usual
                     printf behavior.

              The %b, %q, and %T directives all use the field width and precision arguments from the format specification and write
              that many bytes from (or use that wide a field for) the expanded argument, which  usually  contains  more  characters
              than the original.

              Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C constants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is al‐
              lowed, and if the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII value of the following  char‐
              acter.

              The  format  is  reused as necessary to consume all of the arguments.  If the format requires more arguments than are
              supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a zero value or null string, as  appropriate,  had  been  sup‐
              plied.  The return value is zero on success, non-zero on failure.

       pushd [-n] [+n] [-n]
       pushd [-n] [dir]
              Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the current
              working directory.  With no arguments, pushd exchanges the top two elements of the directory  stack.   Arguments,  if
              supplied, have the following meanings:
              -n     Suppresses  the  normal change of directory when rotating or adding directories to the stack, so that only the
                     stack is manipulated.
              +n     Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the left of the list shown by dirs,  starting  with
                     zero) is at the top.
              -n     Rotates  the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with
                     zero) is at the top.
              dir    Adds dir to the directory stack at the top

              After the stack has been modified, if the -n option was not supplied, pushd uses the cd builtin to change to the  di‐
              rectory at the top of the stack.  If the cd fails, pushd returns a non-zero value.

              Otherwise,  if no arguments are supplied, pushd returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty.  When rotating the di‐
              rectory stack, pushd returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty or a non-existent directory stack element is spec‐
              ified.

              If the pushd command is successful, bash runs dirs to show the final contents of the directory stack.

       pwd [-LP]
              Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.  The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the
              -P option is supplied or the -o physical option to the set builtin command is enabled.  If the -L option is used, the
              pathname printed may contain symbolic links.  The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the name of
              the current directory or an invalid option is supplied.

       read [-ers] [-a aname] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]
              One line is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor fd supplied as an argument to  the  -u  option,
              split  into words as described in bash(1) under Word Splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first name, the
              second word to the second name, and so on.  If there are more words than names, the remaining words and their  inter‐
              vening delimiters are assigned to the last name.  If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the
              remaining names are assigned empty values.  The characters in IFS are used to split the line  into  words  using  the
              same rules the shell uses for expansion (described in bash(1) under Word Splitting).  The backslash character (\) may
              be used to remove any special meaning for the next character read and for line continuation.  Options,  if  supplied,
              have the following meanings:
              -a aname
                     The  words  are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable aname, starting at 0.  aname is unset be‐
                     fore any new values are assigned.  Other name arguments are ignored.
              -d delim
                     The first character of delim is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.  If delim is the  empty
                     string, read will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
              -e     If  the  standard  input  is  coming from a terminal, readline (see READLINE in bash(1)) is used to obtain the
                     line.  Readline uses the current (or default, if line editing was not previously active) editing settings, but
                     uses readline's default filename completion.
              -i text
                     If readline is being used to read the line, text is placed into the editing buffer before editing begins.
              -n nchars
                     read  returns  after  reading nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, but honors a
                     delimiter if fewer than nchars characters are read before the delimiter.
              -N nchars
                     read returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input,  unless
                     EOF is encountered or read times out.  Delimiter characters encountered in the input are not treated specially
                     and do not cause read to return until nchars characters are read.  The result is not split on  the  characters
                     in  IFS;  the intent is that the variable is assigned exactly the characters read (with the exception of back‐
                     slash; see the -r option below).
              -p prompt
                     Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any input.  The prompt
                     is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
              -r     Backslash  does  not act as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part of the line.  In par‐
                     ticular, a backslash-newline pair may not then be used as a line continuation.
              -s     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
              -t timeout
                     Cause read to time out and return failure if a complete line of input (or a specified number of characters) is
                     not read within timeout seconds.  timeout may be a decimal number with a fractional portion following the dec‐
                     imal point.  This option is only effective if read is reading input from a terminal, pipe,  or  other  special
                     file;  it has no effect when reading from regular files.  If read times out, read saves any partial input read
                     into the specified variable name.  If timeout is 0, read returns immediately, without trying to read any data.
                     The exit status is 0 if input is available on the specified file descriptor, or the read will return EOF, non-
                     zero otherwise.  The exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded.
              -u fd  Read input from file descriptor fd.

              If no names are supplied, the line read, without the ending delimiter but otherwise unmodified, is  assigned  to  the
              variable REPLY.  The exit status is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out (in which case the status
              is greater than 128), a variable assignment error (such as assigning to a readonly variable) occurs,  or  an  invalid
              file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.

       readonly [-aAf] [-p] [name[=word] ...]
              The  given  names are marked readonly; the values of these names may not be changed by subsequent assignment.  If the
              -f option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the names are so marked.  The -a option restricts the variables
              to  indexed  arrays;  the  -A option restricts the variables to associative arrays.  If both options are supplied, -A
              takes precedence.  If no name arguments are given, or if the -p option is supplied, a list of all readonly  names  is
              printed.   The other options may be used to restrict the output to a subset of the set of readonly names.  The -p op‐
              tion causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.  If a variable name is followed by =word,
              the value of the variable is set to word.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the
              names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.

       return [n]
              Causes a function to stop executing and return the value specified by n to its caller.  If n is omitted,  the  return
              status  is that of the last command executed in the function body.  If return is executed by a trap handler, the last
              command used to determine the status is the last command executed before the trap handler.   If  return  is  executed
              during  a  DEBUG trap, the last command used to determine the status is the last command executed by the trap handler
              before return was invoked.  If return is used outside a function, but during execution of a script by the .  (source)
              command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return either n or the exit status of the last command
              executed within the script as the exit status of the script.  If n is supplied, the return value is its least signif‐
              icant 8 bits.  The return status is non-zero if return is supplied a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a func‐
              tion and not during execution of a script by . or source.  Any command associated with the RETURN  trap  is  executed
              before execution resumes after the function or script.

       set [-abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [-o option-name] [--] [-] [arg ...]
       set [+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [+o option-name] [--] [-] [arg ...]
              Without  options,  display the name and value of each shell variable in a format that can be reused as input for set‐
              ting or resetting the currently-set variables.  Read-only variables cannot be reset.  In posix mode, only shell vari‐
              ables are listed.  The output is sorted according to the current locale.  When options are specified, they set or un‐
              set shell attributes.  Any arguments remaining after option processing are treated as values for the  positional  pa‐
              rameters and are assigned, in order, to $1, $2, ...  $n.  Options, if specified, have the following meanings:
              -a      Each  variable or function that is created or modified is given the export attribute and marked for export to
                      the environment of subsequent commands.
              -b      Report the status of terminated background jobs immediately, rather than  before  the  next  primary  prompt.
                      This is effective only when job control is enabled.
              -e      Exit  immediately if a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command
                      (see SHELL GRAMMAR in bash(1)), exits with a non-zero status.  The shell does not exit if  the  command  that
                      fails  is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test following
                      the if or elif reserved words, part of any command executed in a &amp;&amp; or || list except the  command  following
                      the  final  &amp;&amp;  or  ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being in‐
                      verted with !.  If a compound command other than a subshell returns  a  non-zero  status  because  a  command
                      failed  while  -e  was being ignored, the shell does not exit.  A trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the
                      shell exits.  This option applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment separately (see COM‐
                      MAND  EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT in bash(1)), and may cause subshells to exit before executing all the commands in
                      the subshell.

                      If a compound command or shell function executes in a context where -e is being ignored, none of the commands
                      executed  within  the compound command or function body will be affected by the -e setting, even if -e is set
                      and a command returns a failure status.  If a compound command or shell function sets -e while executing in a
                      context  where -e is ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command
                      containing the function call completes.
              -f      Disable pathname expansion.
              -h      Remember the location of commands as they are looked up for execution.  This is enabled by default.
              -k      All arguments in the form of assignment statements are placed in the environment  for  a  command,  not  just
                      those that precede the command name.
              -m      Monitor  mode.   Job control is enabled.  This option is on by default for interactive shells on systems that
                      support it (see JOB CONTROL in bash(1)).  All processes run in a separate process group.  When  a  background
                      job completes, the shell prints a line containing its exit status.
              -n      Read  commands but do not execute them.  This may be used to check a shell script for syntax errors.  This is
                      ignored by interactive shells.
              -o option-name
                      The option-name can be one of the following:
                      allexport
                              Same as -a.
                      braceexpand
                              Same as -B.
                      emacs   Use an emacs-style command line editing interface.  This is enabled by default when the shell is  in‐
                              teractive,  unless  the  shell is started with the --noediting option.  This also affects the editing
                              interface used for read -e.
                      errexit Same as -e.
                      errtrace
                              Same as -E.
                      functrace
                              Same as -T.
                      hashall Same as -h.
                      histexpand
                              Same as -H.
                      history Enable command history, as described in bash(1) under HISTORY.  This option is on by default  in  in‐
                              teractive shells.
                      ignoreeof
                              The  effect  is  as  if  the shell command ``IGNOREEOF=10'' had been executed (see Shell Variables in
                              bash(1)).
                      keyword Same as -k.
                      monitor Same as -m.
                      noclobber
                              Same as -C.
                      noexec  Same as -n.
                      noglob  Same as -f.
                      nolog   Currently ignored.
                      notify  Same as -b.
                      nounset Same as -u.
                      onecmd  Same as -t.
                      physical
                              Same as -P.
                      pipefail
                              If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to  exit  with  a
                              non-zero  status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully.  This option is disabled
                              by default.
                      posix   Change the behavior of bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match  the
                              standard  (posix mode).  See SEE ALSO in bash(1) for a reference to a document that details how posix
                              mode affects bash's behavior.
                      privileged
                              Same as -p.
                      verbose Same as -v.
                      vi      Use a vi-style command line editing interface.  This also affects the editing interface used for read
                              -e.
                      xtrace  Same as -x.
                      If -o is supplied with no option-name, the values of the current options are printed.  If +o is supplied with
                      no option-name, a series of set commands to recreate the current option settings is displayed on the standard
                      output.
              -p      Turn  on  privileged mode.  In this mode, the $ENV and $BASH_ENV files are not processed, shell functions are
                      not inherited from the environment, and the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE  variables,  if  they
                      appear in the environment, are ignored.  If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal
                      to the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, these actions are  taken  and  the  effective
                      user  id  is  set to the real user id.  If the -p option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is not
                      reset.  Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real user and  group
                      ids.
              -r      Enable restricted shell mode.  This option cannot be unset once it has been set.
              -t      Exit after reading and executing one command.
              -u      Treat  unset  variables and parameters other than the special parameters "@" and "*", or array variables sub‐
                      scripted with "@" or "*", as an error when performing parameter expansion.  If expansion is attempted  on  an
                      unset  variable  or  parameter, the shell prints an error message, and, if not interactive, exits with a non-
                      zero status.
              -v      Print shell input lines as they are read.
              -x      After expanding each simple command, for command, case command, select command, or  arithmetic  for  command,
                      display  the  expanded  value  of  PS4, followed by the command and its expanded arguments or associated word
                      list.
              -B      The shell performs brace expansion (see Brace Expansion in bash(1)).  This is on by default.
              -C      If set, bash does not overwrite an existing file with the &gt;, &gt;&amp;, and &lt;&gt; redirection operators.  This  may  be
                      overridden when creating output files by using the redirection operator &gt;| instead of &gt;.
              -E      If  set,  any  trap on ERR is inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a
                      subshell environment.  The ERR trap is normally not inherited in such cases.
              -H      Enable !  style history substitution.  This option is on by default when the shell is interactive.
              -P      If set, the shell does not resolve symbolic links when executing commands such as cd that change the  current
                      working  directory.   It uses the physical directory structure instead.  By default, bash follows the logical
                      chain of directories when performing commands which change the current directory.
              -T      If set, any traps on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions,  and  commands
                      executed in a subshell environment.  The DEBUG and RETURN traps are normally not inherited in such cases.
              --      If  no arguments follow this option, then the positional parameters are unset.  Otherwise, the positional pa‐
                      rameters are set to the args, even if some of them begin with a -.
              -       Signal the end of options, cause all remaining args to be assigned to the positional parameters.  The -x  and
                      -v options are turned off.  If there are no args, the positional parameters remain unchanged.

              The  options are off by default unless otherwise noted.  Using + rather than - causes these options to be turned off.
              The options can also be specified as arguments to an invocation of the shell.  The current  set  of  options  may  be
              found in $-.  The return status is always true unless an invalid option is encountered.

       shift [n]
              The  positional  parameters  from  n+1  ...  are renamed to $1 ....  Parameters represented by the numbers $# down to
              $#-n+1 are unset.  n must be a non-negative number less than or equal to $#.  If n is 0, no parameters  are  changed.
              If  n  is not given, it is assumed to be 1.  If n is greater than $#, the positional parameters are not changed.  The
              return status is greater than zero if n is greater than $# or less than zero; otherwise 0.

       shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]
              Toggle the values of settings controlling optional shell behavior.  The settings can be either  those  listed  below,
              or,  if  the  -o  option is used, those available with the -o option to the set builtin command.  With no options, or
              with the -p option, a list of all settable options is displayed, with an indication of whether or not each is set; if
              optnames  are  supplied, the output is restricted to those options.  The -p option causes output to be displayed in a
              form that may be reused as input.  Other options have the following meanings:
              -s     Enable (set) each optname.
              -u     Disable (unset) each optname.
              -q     Suppresses normal output (quiet mode); the return status indicates whether the optname is set  or  unset.   If
                     multiple  optname arguments are given with -q, the return status is zero if all optnames are enabled; non-zero
                     otherwise.
              -o     Restricts the values of optname to be those defined for the -o option to the set builtin.

              If either -s or -u is used with no optname arguments, shopt shows only those options which are set or unset,  respec‐
              tively.  Unless otherwise noted, the shopt options are disabled (unset) by default.

              The  return status when listing options is zero if all optnames are enabled, non-zero otherwise.  When setting or un‐
              setting options, the return status is zero unless an optname is not a valid shell option.

              The list of shopt options is:

              assoc_expand_once
                      If set, the shell suppresses multiple evaluation of associative array subscripts during arithmetic expression
                      evaluation, while executing builtins that can perform variable assignments, and while executing builtins that
                      perform array dereferencing.
              autocd  If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the argument to the cd  com‐
                      mand.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
              cdable_vars
                      If set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable
                      whose value is the directory to change to.
              cdspell If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected.  The  errors
                      checked  for  are transposed characters, a missing character, and one character too many.  If a correction is
                      found, the corrected filename is printed, and the command proceeds.  This option is only used by  interactive
                      shells.
              checkhash
                      If  set,  bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to execute it.  If a hashed
                      command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.
              checkjobs
                      If set, bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive  shell.   If  any
                      jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without an intervening
                      command (see JOB CONTROL in bash(1)).  The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.
              checkwinsize
                      If set, bash checks the window size after each external (non-builtin) command and, if necessary, updates  the
                      values of LINES and COLUMNS.  This option is enabled by default.
              cmdhist If  set,  bash  attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry.  This allows
                      easy re-editing of multi-line commands.  This option is enabled by default, but only has an effect if command
                      history is enabled, as described in bash(1) under HISTORY.
              compat31
              compat32
              compat40
              compat41
              compat42
              compat43
              compat44
              compat50
                      These control aspects of the shell's compatibility mode (see SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE in bash(1)).

              complete_fullquote
                      If set, bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names when performing completion.  If
                      not set, bash removes metacharacters such as the dollar sign from the set of characters that will  be  quoted
                      in  completed  filenames  when  these  metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words to be com‐
                      pleted.  This means that dollar signs in variable names that expand to directories will not be  quoted;  how‐
                      ever,  any  dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be quoted, either.  This is active only when bash is
                      using backslashes to quote completed filenames.  This variable is set by default, which is the  default  bash
                      behavior in versions through 4.2.

              direxpand
                      If set, bash replaces directory names with the results of word expansion when performing filename completion.
                      This changes the contents of the readline editing buffer.  If not set, bash attempts  to  preserve  what  the
                      user typed.

              dirspell
                      If  set,  bash  attempts  spelling correction on directory names during word completion if the directory name
                      initially supplied does not exist.

              dotglob If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of  pathname  expansion.   The  filenames
                      ``.''  and ``..''  must always be matched explicitly, even if dotglob is set.

              execfail
                      If  set,  a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified as an argument to the
                      exec builtin command.  An interactive shell does not exit if exec fails.

              expand_aliases
                      If set, aliases are expanded as described in bash(1) under ALIASES.  This option is enabled  by  default  for
                      interactive shells.

              extdebug
                      If  set  at  shell invocation, or in a shell startup file, arrange to execute the debugger profile before the
                      shell starts, identical to the --debugger option.  If set after invocation, behavior intended for use by  de‐
                      buggers is enabled:

                      1.     The  -F  option  to the declare builtin displays the source file name and line number corresponding to
                             each function name supplied as an argument.

                      2.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command is skipped and not ex‐
                             ecuted.

                      3.     If  the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value of 2, and the shell is executing in a subroutine
                             (a shell function or a shell script executed by the . or source builtins), the shell simulates a  call
                             to return.

                      4.     BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in their descriptions in bash(1)).

                      5.     Function  tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( com‐
                             mand ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.

                      6.     Error tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with (  command
                             ) inherit the ERR trap.

              extglob If set, the extended pattern matching features described in bash(1) under Pathname Expansion are enabled.

              extquote
                      If  set,  $'string'  and  $"string"  quoting  is  performed within ${parameter} expansions enclosed in double
                      quotes.  This option is enabled by default.

              failglob
                      If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in an expansion error.

              force_fignore
                      If set, the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE shell variable cause words to be ignored when  performing  word
                      completion even if the ignored words are the only possible completions.  See SHELL VARIABLES in bash(1) for a
                      description of FIGNORE.  This option is enabled by default.

              globasciiranges
                      If set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket expressions (see Pattern Matching in bash(1))  be‐
                      have  as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.  That is, the current locale's collating
                      sequence is not taken into account, so b will not collate between A and  B,  and  upper-case  and  lower-case
                      ASCII characters will collate together.

              globskipdots
                      If  set, pathname expansion will never match the filenames ``.''  and ``..'', even if the pattern begins with
                      a ``.''.  This option is enabled by default.

              globstar
                      If set, the pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and zero or more directories
                      and subdirectories.  If the pattern is followed by a /, only directories and subdirectories match.

              gnu_errfmt
                      If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.

              histappend
                      If  set,  the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the HISTFILE variable when the shell
                      exits, rather than overwriting the file.

              histreedit
                      If set, and readline is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.

              histverify
                      If set, and readline is being used, the results of history substitution are not  immediately  passed  to  the
                      shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the readline editing buffer, allowing further modi‐
                      fication.

              hostcomplete
                      If set, and readline is being used, bash will attempt to perform hostname completion when a word containing a
                      @ is being completed (see Completing under READLINE in bash(1)).  This is enabled by default.

              huponexit
                      If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

              inherit_errexit
                      If  set,  command  substitution inherits the value of the errexit option, instead of unsetting it in the sub‐
                      shell environment.  This option is enabled when posix mode is enabled.

              interactive_comments
                      If set, allow a word beginning with # to cause that word and all remaining characters on that line to be  ig‐
                      nored in an interactive shell (see COMMENTS in bash(1)).  This option is enabled by default.

              lastpipe
                      If  set,  and  job  control  is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline not executed in the
                      background in the current shell environment.

              lithist If set, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history  with  embedded  new‐
                      lines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.

              localvar_inherit
                      If set, local variables inherit the value and attributes of a variable of the same name that exists at a pre‐
                      vious scope before any new value is assigned.  The nameref attribute is not inherited.

              localvar_unset
                      If set, calling unset on local variables in previous function scopes marks them so  subsequent  lookups  find
                      them unset until that function returns. This is identical to the behavior of unsetting local variables at the
                      current function scope.

              login_shell
                      The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see INVOCATION in bash(1)).  The value may  not
                      be changed.

              mailwarn
                      If  set,  and a file that bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the last time it was checked, the
                      message ``The mail in mailfile has been read'' is displayed.

              no_empty_cmd_completion
                      If set, and readline is being used, bash will not attempt to search the PATH for  possible  completions  when
                      completion is attempted on an empty line.

              nocaseglob
                      If set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname expansion (see Pathname
                      Expansion in bash(1)).

              nocasematch
                      If set, bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching while executing case  or
                      [[  conditional  commands,  when  performing pattern substitution word expansions, or when filtering possible
                      completions as part of programmable completion.

              noexpand_translation
                      If set, bash encloses the translated results of $"..." quoting in single quotes instead of double quotes.  If
                      the string is not translated, this has no effect.

              nullglob
                      If  set,  bash  allows  patterns which match no files (see Pathname Expansion in bash(1)) to expand to a null
                      string, rather than themselves.

              patsub_replacement
                      If set, bash expands occurrences of &amp; in the replacement string of pattern substitution to the  text  matched
                      by the pattern, as described under Parameter Expansion in bash(1).  This option is enabled by default.

              progcomp
                      If  set,  the  programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion in bash(1)) are enabled.  This
                      option is enabled by default.

              progcomp_alias
                      If set, and programmable completion is enabled, bash treats a command name that doesn't have any  completions
                      as  a  possible alias and attempts alias expansion. If it has an alias, bash attempts programmable completion
                      using the command word resulting from the expanded alias.

              promptvars
                      If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote re‐
                      moval after being expanded as described in PROMPTING in bash(1).  This option is enabled by default.

              restricted_shell
                      The  shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see RESTRICTED SHELL in bash(1)).  The value
                      may not be changed.  This is not reset when the startup files are executed, allowing  the  startup  files  to
                      discover whether or not a shell is restricted.

              shift_verbose
                      If  set,  the shift builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number of positional pa‐
                      rameters.

              sourcepath
                      If set, the . (source) builtin uses the value of PATH to find the directory containing the file  supplied  as
                      an argument.  This option is enabled by default.

              varredir_close
                      If  set, the shell automatically closes file descriptors assigned using the {varname} redirection syntax (see
                      REDIRECTION in bash(1)) instead of leaving them open when the command completes.

              xpg_echo
                      If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.

       suspend [-f]
              Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  A login shell, or a shell without  job  con‐
              trol  enabled,  cannot be suspended; the -f option can be used to override this and force the suspension.  The return
              status is 0 unless the shell is a login shell or job control is not enabled and -f is not supplied.

       test expr
       [ expr ]
              Return a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression expr.  Each opera‐
              tor  and  operand  must be a separate argument.  Expressions are composed of the primaries described in bash(1) under
              CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS.  test does not accept any options, nor does it accept and ignore an argument of -- as signi‐
              fying the end of options.

              Expressions  may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence.  The evaluation
              depends on the number of arguments; see below.  Operator precedence is used when there are five or more arguments.
              ! expr True if expr is false.
              ( expr )
                     Returns the value of expr.  This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.
              expr1 -a expr2
                     True if both expr1 and expr2 are true.
              expr1 -o expr2
                     True if either expr1 or expr2 is true.

              test and [ evaluate conditional expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.
              2 arguments
                     If the first argument is !, the expression is true if and only if the second argument is null.  If  the  first
                     argument  is  one  of the unary conditional operators listed in bash(1) under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the ex‐
                     pression is true if the unary test is true.  If the first argument is not a valid unary conditional  operator,
                     the expression is false.
              3 arguments
                     The  following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the second argument is one of the binary condi‐
                     tional operators listed in bash(1) under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the result of the expression is  the  result
                     of  the  binary  test using the first and third arguments as operands.  The -a and -o operators are considered
                     binary operators when there are three arguments.  If the first argument is !, the value is the negation of the
                     two-argument  test using the second and third arguments.  If the first argument is exactly ( and the third ar‐
                     gument is exactly ), the result is the one-argument test of the second argument.  Otherwise, the expression is
                     false.
              4 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the first argument is !, the result is the nega‐
                     tion of the three-argument expression composed of the remaining arguments.  the two-argument  test  using  the
                     second  and third arguments.  If the first argument is exactly ( and the fourth argument is exactly ), the re‐
                     sult is the two-argument test of the second and third arguments.  Otherwise,  the  expression  is  parsed  and
                     evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed above.

              When used with test or [, the &lt; and &gt; operators sort lexicographically using ASCII ordering.

       times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and for processes run from the shell.  The return status is
              0.

       trap [-lp] [[arg] sigspec ...]
              The command arg is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) sigspec.  If arg is absent (and there is
              a single sigspec) or -, each specified signal is reset to its original disposition (the value it had upon entrance to
              the shell).  If arg is the null string the signal specified by each sigspec is ignored by the shell and by  the  com‐
              mands  it  invokes.   If  arg  is  not  present and -p has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each
              sigspec are displayed.  If no arguments are supplied or if only -p is given, trap prints the list of commands associ‐
              ated  with  each signal.  The -l option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and their corresponding num‐
              bers.  Each sigspec is either a signal name defined in &lt;signal.h&gt;, or a signal number.  Signal names are case  insen‐
              sitive and the SIG prefix is optional.

              If  a sigspec is EXIT (0) the command arg is executed on exit from the shell.  If a sigspec is DEBUG, the command arg
              is executed before every simple command, for command, case command, select command, every arithmetic for command, and
              before  the  first  command executes in a shell function (see SHELL GRAMMAR in bash(1)).  Refer to the description of
              the extdebug option to the shopt builtin for details of its effect on the DEBUG trap.  If a sigspec  is  RETURN,  the
              command  arg  is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source builtins finishes exe‐
              cuting.

              If a sigspec is ERR, the command arg is executed whenever a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple  command),
              a  list,  or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions.  The ERR trap is
              not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a while or until  keyword,  part
              of  the test in an if statement, part of a command executed in a &amp;&amp; or || list except the command following the final
              &amp;&amp; or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted using !.   These
              are the same conditions obeyed by the errexit (-e) option.

              Signals  ignored  upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.  Trapped signals that are not being ignored are
              reset to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created.  The return status is false
              if any sigspec is invalid; otherwise trap returns true.

       type [-aftpP] name [name ...]
              With  no  options,  indicate how each name would be interpreted if used as a command name.  If the -t option is used,
              type prints a string which is one of alias, keyword, function, builtin, or file if name is an alias,  shell  reserved
              word,  function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If the name is not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit
              status of false is returned.  If the -p option is used, type either returns the name of the disk file that  would  be
              executed  if name were specified as a command name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would not return file.  The -P op‐
              tion forces a PATH search for each name, even if ``type -t name'' would not return file.  If a command is hashed,  -p
              and  -P  print  the  hashed value, which is not necessarily the file that appears first in PATH.  If the -a option is
              used, type prints all of the places that contain an executable named name.  This includes aliases and  functions,  if
              and only if the -p option is not also used.  The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using -a.  The -f op‐
              tion suppresses shell function lookup, as with the command builtin.  type returns true if all of  the  arguments  are
              found, false if any are not found.

       ulimit [-HS] -a
       ulimit [-HS] [-bcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPRT [limit]]
              Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such
              control.  The -H and -S options specify that the hard or soft limit is set for the given resource.  A hard limit can‐
              not  be increased by a non-root user once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit.
              If neither -H nor -S is specified, both the soft and hard limits are set.  The value of limit can be a number in  the
              unit  specified  for  the resource or one of the special values hard, soft, or unlimited, which stand for the current
              hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.  If limit is omitted, the current value of  the  soft
              limit of the resource is printed, unless the -H option is given.  When more than one resource is specified, the limit
              name and unit, if appropriate, are printed before the value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:
              -a     All current limits are reported; no limits are set
              -b     The maximum socket buffer size
              -c     The maximum size of core files created
              -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment
              -e     The maximum scheduling priority ("nice")
              -f     The maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
              -i     The maximum number of pending signals
              -k     The maximum number of kqueues that may be allocated
              -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
              -m     The maximum resident set size (many systems do not honor this limit)
              -n     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow this value to be set)
              -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
              -q     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
              -r     The maximum real-time scheduling priority
              -s     The maximum stack size
              -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
              -u     The maximum number of processes available to a single user
              -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell and, on some systems, to its children
              -x     The maximum number of file locks
              -P     The maximum number of pseudoterminals
              -R     The maximum time a real-time process can run before blocking, in microseconds
              -T     The maximum number of threads

              If limit is given, and the -a option is not used, limit is the new value of the specified resource.  If no option  is
              given,  then  -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for -t, which is in seconds; -R, which is in
              microseconds; -p, which is in units of 512-byte blocks; -P, -T, -b, -k, -n, and -u, which are unscaled  values;  and,
              when  in posix mode, -c and -f, which are in 512-byte increments.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or
              argument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.

       umask [-p] [-S] [mode]
              The user file-creation mask is set to mode.  If mode begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number;  oth‐
              erwise  it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by chmod(1).  If mode is omitted, the cur‐
              rent value of the mask is printed.  The -S option causes the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default  output
              is an octal number.  If the -p option is supplied, and mode is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as
              input.  The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no mode argument was  supplied,  and  false
              otherwise.

       unalias [-a] [name ...]
              Remove each name from the list of defined aliases.  If -a is supplied, all alias definitions are removed.  The return
              value is true unless a supplied name is not a defined alias.

       unset [-fv] [-n] [name ...]
              For each name, remove the corresponding variable or function.  If the -v option is given, each name refers to a shell
              variable,  and that variable is removed.  Read-only variables may not be unset.  If -f is specified, each name refers
              to a shell function, and the function definition is removed.  If the -n option is supplied, and name  is  a  variable
              with  the  nameref  attribute, name will be unset rather than the variable it references.  -n has no effect if the -f
              option is supplied.  If no options are supplied, each name refers to a variable; if there  is  no  variable  by  that
              name,  a  function with that name, if any, is unset.  Each unset variable or function is removed from the environment
              passed to subsequent commands.  If any of BASH_ALIASES, BASH_ARGV0, BASH_CMDS, BASH_COMMAND, BASH_SUBSHELL,  BASHPID,
              COMP_WORDBREAKS,  DIRSTACK, EPOCHREALTIME, EPOCHSECONDS, FUNCNAME, GROUPS, HISTCMD, LINENO, RANDOM, SECONDS, or SRAN‐
              DOM are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset.  The exit status is true  un‐
              less a name is readonly or may not be unset.

       wait [-fn] [-p varname] [id ...]
              Wait for each specified child process and return its termination status.  Each id may be a process ID or a job speci‐
              fication; if a job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are waited for.  If  id  is  not  given,  wait
              waits  for  all  running background jobs and the last-executed process substitution, if its process id is the same as
              $!, and the return status is zero.  If the -n option is supplied, wait waits for a single job from the  list  of  ids
              or, if no ids are supplied, any job, to complete and returns its exit status.  If none of the supplied arguments is a
              child of the shell, or if no arguments are supplied and the shell has no unwaited-for children, the  exit  status  is
              127.  If the -p option is supplied, the process or job identifier of the job for which the exit status is returned is
              assigned to the variable varname named by the option argument.  The variable will be unset initially, before any  as‐
              signment.  This is useful only when the -n option is supplied.  Supplying the -f option, when job control is enabled,
              forces wait to wait for id to terminate before returning its status, instead of returning when it changes status.  If
              id specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is 127.  If wait is interrupted by a signal, the return
              status will be greater than 128, as described under SIGNALS in bash(1).  Otherwise, the return  status  is  the  exit
              status of the last process or job waited for.

SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE
       Bash-4.0  introduced  the  concept of a shell compatibility level, specified as a set of options to the shopt builtin ( com‐
       pat31, compat32, compat40, compat41, and so on).  There is only one current compatibility level -- each option  is  mutually
       exclusive.   The compatibility level is intended to allow users to select behavior from previous versions that is incompati‐
       ble with newer versions while they migrate scripts to use current features and behavior. It's intended to be a temporary so‐
       lution.

       This  section does not mention behavior that is standard for a particular version (e.g., setting compat32 means that quoting
       the rhs of the regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the word, which is default behavior in  bash-3.2
       and subsequent versions).

       If  a  user enables, say, compat32, it may affect the behavior of other compatibility levels up to and including the current
       compatibility level.  The idea is that each compatibility level controls behavior that changed in that version of bash,  but
       that  behavior may have been present in earlier versions.  For instance, the change to use locale-based comparisons with the
       [[ command came in bash-4.1, and earlier versions used ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling compat32 will enable ASCII-based
       comparisons as well.  That granularity may not be sufficient for all uses, and as a result users should employ compatibility
       levels carefully.  Read the documentation for a particular feature to find out the current behavior.

       Bash-4.3 introduced a new shell variable: BASH_COMPAT.  The value assigned to this variable (a decimal version  number  like
       4.2, or an integer corresponding to the compatNN option, like 42) determines the compatibility level.

       Starting  with  bash-4.4, Bash has begun deprecating older compatibility levels.  Eventually, the options will be removed in
       favor of BASH_COMPAT.

       Bash-5.0 is the final version for which there will be an individual shopt option for the previous version. Users should  use
       BASH_COMPAT on bash-5.0 and later versions.

       The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by each compatibility level setting.  The compatNN tag is used
       as shorthand for setting the compatibility level to NN using one  of  the  following  mechanisms.   For  versions  prior  to
       bash-5.0,  the  compatibility  level  may be set using the corresponding compatNN shopt option.  For bash-4.3 and later ver‐
       sions, the BASH_COMPAT variable is preferred, and it is required for bash-5.1 and later versions.

       compat31
              •      quoting the rhs of the [[ command's regexp matching operator (=~) has no special effect

       compat32
              •      interrupting a command list such as "a ; b ; c" causes the execution of the  next  command  in  the  list  (in
                     bash-4.0  and later versions, the shell acts as if it received the interrupt, so interrupting one command in a
                     list aborts the execution of the entire list)

       compat40
              •      the &lt; and &gt; operators to the [[ command do not consider the current locale when comparing  strings;  they  use
                     ASCII ordering.  Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use the
                     current locale's collation sequence and strcoll(3).

       compat41
              •      in posix mode, time may be followed by options and still be recognized as a reserved word (this is  POSIX  in‐
                     terpretation 267)
              •      in posix mode, the parser requires that an even number of single quotes occur in the word portion of a double-
                     quoted parameter expansion and treats them specially, so that characters within the single quotes are  consid‐
                     ered quoted (this is POSIX interpretation 221)

       compat42
              •      the  replacement  string  in  double-quoted pattern substitution does not undergo quote removal, as it does in
                     versions after bash-4.2
              •      in posix mode, single quotes are considered special when expanding the word portion of a double-quoted parame‐
                     ter  expansion  and can be used to quote a closing brace or other special character (this is part of POSIX in‐
                     terpretation 221); in later versions, single quotes are not special within double-quoted word expansions

       compat43
              •      the shell does not print a warning message if an attempt is made to use a quoted compound assignment as an ar‐
                     gument to declare (e.g., declare -a foo='(1 2)'). Later versions warn that this usage is deprecated
              •      word  expansion  errors  are considered non-fatal errors that cause the current command to fail, even in posix
                     mode (the default behavior is to make them fatal errors that cause the shell to exit)
              •      when executing a shell function, the loop state (while/until/etc.)  is not reset, so break or continue in that
                     function  will break or continue loops in the calling context. Bash-4.4 and later reset the loop state to pre‐
                     vent this

       compat44
              •      the shell sets up the values used by BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC so they can expand to the shell's positional  pa‐
                     rameters even if extended debugging mode is not enabled
              •      a  subshell  inherits  loops  from  its  parent context, so break or continue will cause the subshell to exit.
                     Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop state to prevent the exit
              •      variable assignments preceding builtins like export and readonly that set attributes continue to affect  vari‐
                     ables with the same name in the calling environment even if the shell is not in posix mode

       compat50
              •      Bash-5.1  changed the way $RANDOM is generated to introduce slightly more randomness. If the shell compatibil‐
                     ity level is set to 50 or lower, it reverts to the method from bash-5.0 and previous versions, so seeding  the
                     random number generator by assigning a value to RANDOM will produce the same sequence as in bash-5.0
              •      If  the  command hash table is empty, bash versions prior to bash-5.1 printed an informational message to that
                     effect, even when producing output that can be reused as input. Bash-5.1 suppresses that message when  the  -l
                     option is supplied.

       compat51
              •      The unset builtin treats attempts to unset array subscripts @ and * differently depending on whether the array
                     is indexed or associative, and differently than in previous versions.
