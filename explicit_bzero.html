<pre>bzero(3)                                              Library Functions Manual                                             bzero(3)

NAME
       bzero, explicit_bzero - zero a byte string

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;strings.h&gt;

       void bzero(void s[.n], size_t n);

       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       void explicit_bzero(void s[.n], size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The bzero() function erases the data in the n bytes of the memory starting at the location pointed to by s, by writing zeros
       (bytes containing '\0') to that area.

       The explicit_bzero() function performs the same task as bzero().  It differs from bzero() in that it  guarantees  that  com‐
       piler optimizations will not remove the erase operation if the compiler deduces that the operation is "unnecessary".

RETURN VALUE
       None.

VERSIONS
       explicit_bzero() first appeared in glibc 2.25.

STANDARDS
       The  bzero() function is deprecated (marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001); use memset(3) in new programs.  POSIX.1-2008 removes
       the specification of bzero().  The bzero() function first appeared in 4.3BSD.

       The explicit_bzero() function is a nonstandard extension that is also present on some of the BSDs.  Some  other  implementa‐
       tions have a similar function, such as memset_explicit() or memset_s().

NOTES
       The  explicit_bzero()  function addresses a problem that security-conscious applications may run into when using bzero(): if
       the compiler can deduce that the location to be zeroed will never again be touched by a correct program, then it may  remove
       the  bzero()  call altogether.  This is a problem if the intent of the bzero() call was to erase sensitive data (e.g., pass‐
       words) to prevent the possibility that the data was leaked by an incorrect or compromised program.  Calls  to  explicit_bze‐
       ro() are never optimized away by the compiler.

       The explicit_bzero() function does not solve all problems associated with erasing sensitive data:

       •  The explicit_bzero() function does not guarantee that sensitive data is completely erased from memory.  (The same is true
          of bzero().)  For example, there may be copies of the sensitive data in a register and in "scratch" stack areas.  The ex‐
          plicit_bzero() function is not aware of these copies, and can't erase them.

       •  In  some  circumstances, explicit_bzero() can decrease security.  If the compiler determined that the variable containing
          the sensitive data could be optimized to be stored in a register (because it is small enough to fit in a register, and no
          operation other than the explicit_bzero() call would need to take the address of the variable), then the explicit_bzero()
          call will force the data to be copied from the register to a location in RAM that is then immediately erased  (while  the
          copy  in  the  register  remains unaffected).  The problem here is that data in RAM is more likely to be exposed by a bug
          than data in a register, and thus the explicit_bzero() call creates a brief time window where the sensitive data is  more
          vulnerable than it would otherwise have been if no attempt had been made to erase the data.

       Note  that  declaring  the sensitive variable with the volatile qualifier does not eliminate the above problems.  Indeed, it
       will make them worse, since, for example, it may force a variable that would otherwise have been optimized into  a  register
       to instead be maintained in (more vulnerable) RAM for its entire lifetime.

       Notwithstanding  the  above  details, for security-conscious applications, using explicit_bzero() is generally preferable to
       not using it.  The developers of explicit_bzero() anticipate that future compilers will recognize calls to  explicit_bzero()
       and  take  steps  to  ensure that all copies of the sensitive data are erased, including copies in registers or in "scratch"
       stack areas.
