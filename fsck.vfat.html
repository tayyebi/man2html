<pre>FSCK.FAT(8)                                           System Manager's Manual                                           FSCK.FAT(8)

NAME
       fsck.fat - check and repair MS-DOS FAT filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.fat [OPTIONS] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       fsck.fat verifies the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems and optionally tries to repair them.

       The following filesystem problems can be corrected (in this order):

       •   FAT contains invalid cluster numbers.  Cluster is changed to EOF.

       •   File's cluster chain contains a loop.  The loop is broken.

       •   Bad clusters (read errors).  The clusters are marked bad and they are removed from files owning them.  This check is op‐
           tional.

       •   Directories with a large number of bad entries (probably corrupt).  The directory can be deleted.

       •   Files . and .. are non-directories.  They can be deleted or renamed.

       •   Directories . and .. in root directory.  They are deleted.

       •   Bad filenames.  They can be renamed.

       •   Duplicate directory entries.  They can be deleted or renamed.

       •   Directories with non-zero size field.  Size is set to zero.

       •   Directory . does not point to parent directory.  The start pointer is adjusted.

       •   Directory .. does not point to parent of parent directory.  The start pointer is adjusted.

       •   . and .. are not the two first entries in a non-root directory.  The entries are created, moving occupied slots if  nec‐
           essary.

       •   Start cluster number of a file is invalid.  The file is truncated.

       •   File contains bad or free clusters.  The file is truncated.

       •   File's cluster chain is longer than indicated by the size fields.  The file is truncated.

       •   Two  or more files share the same cluster(s).  All but one of the files are truncated.  If the file being truncated is a
           directory file that has already been read, the filesystem check is restarted after truncation.

       •   File's cluster chain is shorter than indicated by the size fields.  The file is truncated.

       •   Volume label in root directory or label in boot sector is invalid.  Invalid labels are removed.

       •   Volume label in root directory and label in boot sector are different.  Volume label from root directory  is  copied  to
           boot sector.

       •   Clusters are marked as used but are not owned by a file.  They are marked as free.

       Additionally, the following problems are detected, but not repaired:

       •   Invalid parameters in boot sector

       When  fsck.fat  checks  a  filesystem, it accumulates all changes in memory and performs them only after all checks are com‐
       plete.  This can be disabled with the -w option.

       Two different variants of the FAT filesystem are supported.  Standard is the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 filesystems  as  defined
       by  Microsoft and widely used on hard disks and removable media like USB sticks and SD cards.  The other is the legacy Atari
       variant used on Atari ST.

       There are some minor differences in Atari format: Some boot sector fields are interpreted slightly different, and  the  spe‐
       cial  FAT  entries  for end-of-file and bad cluster can be different.  Under MS-DOS 0xfff8 is used for EOF and Atari employs
       0xffff by default, but both systems recognize all values from 0xfff8–0xffff as end-of-file.  MS-DOS uses only 0xfff7 for bad
       clusters, where on Atari values 0xfff0–0xfff7 are for this purpose (but the standard value is still 0xfff7).

OPTIONS
       -a  Automatically  repair  the  filesystem.   No  user intervention is necessary.  Whenever there is more than one method to
           solve a problem, the least destructive approach is used.

       -A  Select using the Atari variation of the FAT filesystem if that isn't  active  already,  otherwise  select  standard  FAT
           filesystem.  This is selected by default if mkfs.fat is run on 68k Atari Linux.

       -b  Make read-only boot sector check.

       -c PAGE
           Use DOS codepage PAGE to decode short file names.  By default codepage 850 is used.

       -d PATH
           Delete  the  specified  file.  If more than one file with that name exist, the first one is deleted.  This option can be
           given more than once.

       -f  Salvage unused cluster chains to files.  By default, unused clusters are added to the free disk  space  except  in  auto
           mode (-a).

       -F NUM
           Specify  FAT table NUM for filesystem access.  By default value 0 is assumed and then the first uncorrupted FAT table is
           chosen.  Uncorrupted means that FAT table has valid first cluster.  If default value 0 is used and all  FAT  tables  are
           corrupted  then  fsck.fat  gives  up and does not try to repair FAT filesystem.  If non-zero NUM value is specified then
           fsck.fat uses FAT table NUM for repairing FAT filesystem.  If FAT table NUM has corrupted first  cluster  then  fsck.fat
           will  repair it.  In any case, if FAT filesystem has more FAT tables then repaired content of chosen FAT table is copied
           to other FAT tables.  To repair corrupted first cluster it is required to call fsck.fat with non-zero NUM value.

       -l  List path names of files being processed.

       -n  No-operation mode: non-interactively check for errors, but don't write anything to the filesystem.

       -p  Same as -a, for compatibility with other *fsck.

       -r  Interactively repair the filesystem.  The user is asked for advice whenever there is more than one approach  to  fix  an
           inconsistency.  This is the default mode and the option is only retained for backwards compatibility.

       -S  Consider  short  (8.3)  file  names with spaces in the middle to be invalid, like previous versions of this program did.
           While such file names are not forbidden by the FAT specification, and were never treated as  errors  by  Microsoft  file
           system  checking  tools,  many DOS programs are unable to handle files with such names.  Using this option can make them
           accessible to these programs.

           Short file names which start with a space are considered invalid regardless of this option's setting.

           Previous versions of this program exceptionally treated EA DATA. SF and WP ROOT. SF as valid short names; using this op‐
           tion does not preserve that exception.

       -t  Mark unreadable clusters as bad.

       -u PATH
           Try  to  undelete  the  specified file.  fsck.fat tries to allocate a chain of contiguous unallocated clusters beginning
           with the start cluster of the undeleted file.  This option can be given more than once.

       -U  Consider lowercase volume and boot label as invalid and allow only uppercase characters.  Such labels are  forbidden  by
           the  FAT  specification, but they are widely used by Linux tools.  Moreover MS-DOS and Windows systems do not have prob‐
           lems to read them.  Therefore volume and boot labels with lowercase characters are by default permitted.

       -v  Verbose mode.  Generates slightly more output.

       -V  Perform a verification pass.  The filesystem check is repeated after the first run.  The second pass should never report
           any fixable errors.  It may take considerably longer than the first pass, because the first pass may have generated long
           list of modifications that have to be scanned for each disk read.

       --variant TYPE
           Create a filesystem of variant TYPE.  Acceptable values are standard and atari (in any combination of upper/lower case).
           See above under DESCRIPTION for the differences.

       -w  Write changes to disk immediately.

       -y  Same as -a (automatically repair filesystem) for compatibility with other fsck tools.

       --help
           Display help message describing usage and options then exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0   No recoverable errors have been detected.

       1   Recoverable errors have been detected or fsck.fat has discovered an internal inconsistency.

       2   Usage error.  fsck.fat did not access the filesystem.

FILES
       fsck0000.rec, fsck0001.rec, ...
           When  recovering  from  a  corrupted  filesystem, fsck.fat dumps recovered data into files named fsckNNNN.rec in the top
           level directory of the filesystem.

BUGS
       •   Does not remove entirely empty directories.

       •   Should give more diagnostic messages.

       •   Undeleting files should use a more sophisticated algorithm.
