NAME
       docker-image-pull - Download an image from a registry

SYNOPSIS
       docker image pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  pulls  down an image or a repository from a registry. If there is more than one image for a repository (e.g.,
       fedora) then all images for that repository name can be pulled down including any tags (see the option -a or --all-tags).

       If you do not specify a REGISTRY_HOST, the command uses Docker's public registry located at registry-1.docker.io by default.

EXAMPLES
   Pull an image from Docker Hub
       To download a particular image, or set of images (i.e., a repository), use docker image pull (or the docker pull shorthand).
       If no tag is provided, Docker Engine uses the :latest tag as a default. This example pulls the debian:latest image:

              $ docker image pull debian

              Using default tag: latest
              latest: Pulling from library/debian
              e756f3fdd6a3: Pull complete
              Digest: sha256:3f1d6c17773a45c97bd8f158d665c9709d7b29ed7917ac934086ad96f92e4510
              Status: Downloaded newer image for debian:latest
              docker.io/library/debian:latest

       Docker images can consist of multiple layers. In the example above, the image consists of a single layer; e756f3fdd6a3.

       Layers  can be reused by images. For example, the debian:bullseye image shares its layer with the debian:latest. Pulling the
       debian:bullseye image therefore only pulls its metadata, but not its layers, because the layer is already present locally:

              $ docker image pull debian:bullseye

              bullseye: Pulling from library/debian
              Digest: sha256:3f1d6c17773a45c97bd8f158d665c9709d7b29ed7917ac934086ad96f92e4510
              Status: Downloaded newer image for debian:bullseye
              docker.io/library/debian:bullseye

       To see which images are present locally, use the docker-images(1) command:

              $ docker images

              REPOSITORY   TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
              debian       bullseye   4eacea30377a   8 days ago     124MB
              debian       latest     4eacea30377a   8 days ago     124MB

       Docker uses a content-addressable image store, and the image ID is a SHA256 digest covering the  image's  configuration  and
       layers.  In  the  example  above,  debian:bullseye  and debian:latest have the same image ID because they are the same image
       tagged with different names. Because they are the same image, their layers are stored only once and  do  not  consume  extra
       disk space.

       For  more  information  about images, layers, and the content-addressable store, refer to understand images, containers, and
       storage drivers ⟨https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/⟩ in the online documentation.

Pull an image by digest (immutable identifier)
       So far, you've pulled images by their name (and "tag"). Using names and tags is a convenient way to work with  images.  When
       using  tags,  you can docker image pull an image again to make sure you have the most up-to-date version of that image.  For
       example, docker image pull ubuntu:22.04 pulls the latest version of the Ubuntu 22.04 image.

       In some cases you don't want images to be updated to newer versions, but prefer to use a fixed version of an  image.  Docker
       enables  you  to pull an image by its digest. When pulling an image by digest, you specify exactly which version of an image
       to pull. Doing so, allows you to "pin" an image to that version, and guarantee that the image you're  using  is  always  the
       same.

       To know the digest of an image, pull the image first. Let's pull the latest ubuntu:22.04 image from Docker Hub:

              $ docker image pull ubuntu:22.04

              22.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu
              125a6e411906: Pull complete
              Digest: sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d
              Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:22.04
              docker.io/library/ubuntu:22.04

       Docker prints the digest of the image after the pull has finished. In the example above, the digest of the image is:

              sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d

       Docker  also prints the digest of an image when pushing to a registry. This may be useful if you want to pin to a version of
       the image you just pushed.

       A digest takes the place of the tag when pulling an image, for example, to pull the above image by digest, run the following
       command:

              $ docker image pull ubuntu@sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d

              docker.io/library/ubuntu@sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d: Pulling from library/ubuntu
              Digest: sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d
              Status: Image is up to date for ubuntu@sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d
              docker.io/library/ubuntu@sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d

       Digest can also be used in the FROM of a Dockerfile, for example:

              FROM ubuntu@sha256:26c68657ccce2cb0a31b330cb0be2b5e108d467f641c62e13ab40cbec258c68d
              LABEL org.opencontainers.image.authors="some maintainer &lt;maintainer@example.com&gt;"

              Note

              Using this feature "pins" an image to a specific version in time.  Docker does therefore not pull updated versions of
              an image, which may include security updates. If you want to pull an updated image, you need to change the digest ac‐
              cordingly.

Pull from a different registry
       By  default,  docker image pull pulls images from Docker Hub. It is also possible to manually specify the path of a registry
       to pull from. For example, if you have set up a local registry, you can specify its path to pull from it. A registry path is
       similar to a URL, but does not contain a protocol specifier (https://).

       The  following  command  pulls  the  testing/test-image  image  from a local registry listening on port 5000 (myregistry.lo‐
       cal:5000):

              $ docker image pull myregistry.local:5000/testing/test-image

       Registry credentials are managed by docker-login(1).

       Docker uses the https:// protocol to communicate with a registry, unless the registry is allowed to be accessed over an  in‐
       secure connection. Refer to the insecure registries ⟨https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#insecure-
       registries⟩ section in the online documentation for more information.

Pull a repository with multiple images
       By default, docker image pull pulls a single image from the registry. A repository can contain multiple images. To pull  all
       images from a repository, provide the -a (or --all-tags) option when using docker image pull.

       This command pulls all images from the ubuntu repository:

              $ docker image pull --all-tags ubuntu

              Pulling repository ubuntu
              ad57ef8d78d7: Download complete
              105182bb5e8b: Download complete
              511136ea3c5a: Download complete
              73bd853d2ea5: Download complete

              Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu

       After  the  pull  has  completed  use  the  docker image ls (or docker images shorthand) command to see the images that were
       pulled. The example below shows all the ubuntu images that are present locally:

              $ docker image ls --filter reference=ubuntu
              REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
              ubuntu       18.04     c6ad7e71ba7d   5 weeks ago    63.2MB
              ubuntu       bionic    c6ad7e71ba7d   5 weeks ago    63.2MB
              ubuntu       22.04     5ccefbfc0416   2 months ago   78MB
              ubuntu       focal     ff0fea8310f3   2 months ago   72.8MB
              ubuntu       latest    ff0fea8310f3   2 months ago   72.8MB
              ubuntu       jammy     41ba606c8ab9   3 months ago   79MB
              ubuntu       20.04     ba6acccedd29   7 months ago   72.8MB

Cancel a pull
       Killing the docker image pull process, for example by pressing CTRL-c while it is running in a terminal, will terminate  the
       pull operation.

              $ docker image pull ubuntu

              Using default tag: latest
              latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu
              a3ed95caeb02: Pulling fs layer
              236608c7b546: Pulling fs layer
              ^C

       The  Engine  terminates  a  pull operation when the connection between the Docker Engine daemon and the Docker Engine client
       initiating the pull is lost. If the connection with the Engine daemon is lost for other reasons than a  manual  interaction,
       the pull is also aborted.
