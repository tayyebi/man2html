NAME
       dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options

DESCRIPTION
       The  Dynamic  Host  Configuration  protocol allows the client to receive options from the DHCP server describing the network
       configuration and various services that are available on the network.  When configuring dhcpd(8) or  dhclient(8)  ,  options
       must  often  be  declared.  The syntax for declaring options, and the names and formats of the options that can be declared,
       are documented here.

REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
       DHCP option statements always start with the option keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.   The  op‐
       tion  names and data formats are described below.  It is not necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those
       options which are needed by clients must be specified.

       Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:

       The ip-address data type can be entered either as an explicit IP address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain  name  (e.g.,
       haagen.isc.org).   When entering a domain name, be sure that that domain name resolves to a single IP address. Additionally,
       please note the software (dhcpd or dhclient) will only attempt to resolve the domain name  the  first  time  the  option  is
       needed.  For example, if the next-server option is defined as a domain name, dhcpd will attempt to resolve it while respond‐
       ing to the first client query dhcpd receives after startup. Should the domain's address subsequently  change,  the  software
       has to be restarted in order to pick up the change.

       The ip6-address data specifies an IPv6 address, like ::1 or 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1.

       The  int32  data  type  specifies  a signed 32-bit integer.  The uint32 data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.  The
       int16 and uint16 data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.  The int8 and uint8 data types specify  signed  and
       unsigned 8-bit integers.  Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.

       The  text data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a root-
       path option, the syntax would be

       option root-path "10.0.1.4:/var/tmp/rootfs";

       The domain-name data type specifies a domain name, which must not be enclosed in double quotes.  The domain name  is  stored
       just as if it were a text option.

       The  domain-list  data  type  specifies  a  list  of domain names, enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas ("exam‐
       ple.com", "foo.example.com").

       The flag data type specifies a boolean value.  Booleans can be either true or false (or on or off, if that makes more  sense
       to you).

       The  string  data  type  specifies  either an NVT ASCII string enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
       hexadecimal, separated by colons.  For example:

         option dhcp-client-identifier "CLIENT-FOO";
       or
         option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;

SETTING OPTION VALUES USING EXPRESSIONS
       Sometimes it's helpful to be able to set the value of a DHCP option based on some value that the client  has  sent.   To  do
       this,  you  can  use expression evaluation.  The dhcp-eval(5) manual page describes how to write expressions.  To assign the
       result of an evaluation to an option, define the option as follows:

         option my-option = expression ;

       For example:

         option hostname = binary-to-ascii (16, 8, "-",
                                            substring (hardware, 1, 6));

INCLUDING OPTION DEFINITIONS
       Starting with 4.3.0 when ISC adds new option definitions those definitions will be included in the code based on the defini‐
       tion of an argument for the RFC that defines the option in includes/site.h.  This provides you with a method for over-riding
       the ISC definitions if necessary - for example if you have previously defined the option with a different format  using  the
       mechanism from DEFINING NEW OPTIONS below.

       By  default  all of the options are enabled.  In order to disable an option you would edit the includes/site.h file and com‐
       ment out the definition for the proper RFC.

STANDARD DHCPV4 OPTIONS
       The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.  Op‐
       tions not listed below may not yet be implemented, but it is possible to use such options by defining them in the configura‐
       tion file.  Please see the DEFINING NEW OPTIONS heading later in this document for more information.

       Some of the options documented here are automatically generated by the DHCP server or by clients, and cannot  be  configured
       by the user.  The value of such an option can be used in the configuration file of the receiving DHCP protocol agent (server
       or client), for example in conditional expressions. However, the value of the option cannot be  used  in  the  configuration
       file of the sending agent, because the value is determined only after the configuration file has been processed. In the fol‐
       lowing documentation, such options will be shown as "not user configurable"

       The standard options are:

       option all-subnets-local flag;

         This option specifies whether or not the client may assume that all subnets of the IP network to which the client is  con‐
         nected  use  the  same MTU as the subnet of that network to which the client is directly connected.  A value of true indi‐
         cates that all subnets share the same MTU.  A value of false means that the client should assume that some subnets of  the
         directly connected network may have smaller MTUs.

       option arp-cache-timeout uint32;

         This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP cache entries.

       option associated-ip ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         This option is part of lease query.  It is used to return all of the IP addresses associated with a given DHCP client.

         This option is not user configurable.

       option bcms-controller-address ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         This option configures a list of IPv4 addresses for use as Broadcast and Multicast Controller Servers ("BCMS").

       option bcms-controller-names domain-list;

         This  option  contains the domain names of local Broadcast and Multicast Controller Servers ("BCMS") controllers which the
         client may use.

       option bootfile-name text;

         This option is used to identify a bootstrap file.  If supported by the client, it should have the same effect as the file‐
         name declaration.  BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.  Some DHCP clients will support it, and others actu‐
         ally require it.

       option boot-size uint16;

         This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of the default boot image for the client.

       option broadcast-address ip-address;

         This option specifies the broadcast address in use on the client's subnet.  Legal values for broadcast addresses are spec‐
         ified in section 3.2.1.3 of STD 3 (RFC1122).

       option capwap-ac-v4 ip-address [, ip-address ... ] ;

         A list of IPv4 addresses of CAPWAP ACs that the WTP may use.  The addresses are listed in preference order.

         This option is included based on RFC 5417.

       option client-last-transaction-time uint32;

         This option is part of lease query.  It allows the receiver to determine the time of the most recent access by the client.
         The value is a duration in seconds from when the client last communicated with the DHCP server.

         This option is not user configurable.

       option cookie-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The cookie server option specifies a list of RFC 865 cookie servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed  in
         order of preference.

       option default-ip-ttl uint8;

         This option specifies the default time-to-live that the client should use on outgoing datagrams.

       option default-tcp-ttl uint8;

         This option specifies the default TTL that the client should use when sending TCP segments.  The minimum value is 1.

       option default-url string;

         The  format  and  meaning  of this option is not described in any standards document, but is claimed to be in use by Apple
         Computer.  It is not known what clients may reasonably do if supplied with this option.  Use at your own risk.

       option dhcp-client-identifier string;

         This option can be used to specify a DHCP client identifier in a host declaration, so that dhcpd can find the host  record
         by matching against the client identifier.

         Please  be  aware that some DHCP clients, when configured with client identifiers that are ASCII text, will prepend a zero
         to the ASCII text.  So you may need to write:

              option dhcp-client-identifier "\0foo";

         rather than:

              option dhcp-client-identifier "foo";

       option dhcp-lease-time uint32;

         This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST) to allow the client to request a lease time for  the
         IP  address.  In a server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP server uses this option to specify the lease time it is willing to of‐
         fer.

         This option is not directly user configurable in the server; refer to the max-lease-time and default-lease-time server op‐
         tions in dhcpd.conf(5).

       option dhcp-max-message-size uint16;

         This  option,  when  sent  by  the client, specifies the maximum size of any response that the server sends to the client.
         When specified on the server, if the client did not send a dhcp-max-message-size option, the size specified on the  server
         is used.  This works for BOOTP as well as DHCP responses.

       option dhcp-message text;

         This  option  is used by a DHCP server to provide an error message to a DHCP client in a DHCPNAK message in the event of a
         failure. A client may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE message to indicate why the client declined the offered parameters.

         This option is not user configurable.

       option dhcp-message-type uint8;

         This option, sent by both client and server, specifies the type of DHCP message contained in  the  DHCP  packet.  Possible
         values (taken directly from RFC2132) are:

                      1     DHCPDISCOVER
                      2     DHCPOFFER
                      3     DHCPREQUEST
                      4     DHCPDECLINE
                      5     DHCPACK
                      6     DHCPNAK
                      7     DHCPRELEASE
                      8     DHCPINFORM

         This option is not user configurable.

       option dhcp-option-overload uint8;

         This  option  is  used to indicate that the DHCP ´sname´ or ´file´ fields are being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP
         options. A DHCP server inserts this option if the returned parameters will exceed the usual space allotted for options.

         If this option is present, the client interprets the specified additional fields after it concludes interpretation of  the
         standard option fields.

         Legal values for this option are:

                      1     the ´file´ field is used to hold options
                      2     the ´sname´ field is used to hold options
                      3     both fields are used to hold options

         This option is not user configurable.

       option dhcp-parameter-request-list uint8 [, uint8... ];

         This  option,  when  sent by the client, specifies which options the client wishes the server to return.  Normally, in the
         ISC DHCP client, this is done using the request statement.  If this option is not specified by the client, the DHCP server
         will  normally  return every option that is valid in scope and that fits into the reply.  When this option is specified on
         the server, the server returns the specified options.  This can be used to force a client to take options that  it  hasn't
         requested,  and it can also be used to tailor the response of the DHCP server for clients that may need a more limited set
         of options than those the server would normally return.

       option dhcp-rebinding-time uint32;

         This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets an address until the client transitions to the RE‐
         BINDING state.

         This option is user configurable, but it will be ignored if the value is greater than or equal to the lease time.

         To  make  DHCPv4+DHCPv6  migration easier in the future, any value configured in this option is also used as a DHCPv6 "T1"
         (renew) time.

       option dhcp-renewal-time uint32;

         This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets an address until the client transitions to the RE‐
         NEWING state.

         This  option  is user configurable, but it will be ignored if the value is greater than or equal to the rebinding time, or
         lease time.

         To make DHCPv4+DHCPv6 migration easier in the future, any value configured in this option is also used as  a  DHCPv6  "T2"
         (rebind) time.

       option dhcp-requested-address ip-address;

         This option is used by the client in a DHCPDISCOVER to request that a particular IP address be assigned.

         This option is not user configurable.

       option dhcp-server-identifier ip-address;

         This  option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST messages, and may optionally be included in the DHCPACK and DHCPNAK mes‐
         sages.  DHCP servers include this option in the DHCPOFFER in order to allow the client to distinguish  between  lease  of‐
         fers.   DHCP  clients  use  the contents of the ´server identifier´ field as the destination address for any DHCP messages
         unicast to the DHCP server.  DHCP clients also indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted by including  this
         option in a DHCPREQUEST message.

         The value of this option is the IP address of the server.

         This option is not directly user configurable. See the server-identifier server option in dhcpd.conf(5).

       option domain-name text;

         This option specifies the domain name that client should use when resolving hostnames via the Domain Name System.

       option domain-name-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The  domain-name-servers  option  specifies  a list of Domain Name System (STD 13, RFC 1035) name servers available to the
         client.  Servers should be listed in order of preference.

       option domain-search domain-list;

         The domain-search option specifies a ´search list´ of Domain Names to be used by the client to locate  not-fully-qualified
         domain  names.   The  difference  between this option and historic use of the domain-name option for the same ends is that
         this option is encoded in RFC1035 compressed labels on the wire.  For example:

           option domain-search "example.com", "sales.example.com",
                                "eng.example.com";

       option extensions-path text;

         This option specifies the name of a file containing additional options to be interpreted according to the DHCP option for‐
         mat as specified in RFC2132.

       option finger-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The Finger server option specifies a list of Finger servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of
         preference.

       option font-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         This option specifies a list of X Window System Font servers available to the client. Servers should be listed in order of
         preference.

       option geoconf-civic string;

         A string to hold the geoconf civic structure.

         This option is included based on RFC 4776.

       option host-name string;

         This  option  specifies  the  name  of the client.  The name may or may not be qualified with the local domain name (it is
         preferable to use the domain-name option to specify the domain name).  See RFC 1035 for character set restrictions.   This
         option is only honored by dhclient-script(8) if the hostname for the client machine is not set.

       option ieee802-3-encapsulation flag;

         This  option specifies whether or not the client should use Ethernet Version 2 (RFC 894) or IEEE 802.3 (RFC 1042) encapsu‐
         lation if the interface is an Ethernet.  A value of false indicates that the client should use RFC 894  encapsulation.   A
         value of true means that the client should use RFC 1042 encapsulation.

       option ien116-name-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The ien116-name-servers option specifies a list of IEN 116 name servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed
         in order of preference.

       option impress-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The impress-server option specifies a list of Imagen Impress servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in
         order of preference.

       option interface-mtu uint16;

         This option specifies the MTU to use on this interface.  The minimum legal value for the MTU is 68.

       option ip-forwarding flag;

         This option specifies whether the client should configure its IP layer for packet forwarding.  A value of false means dis‐
         able IP forwarding, and a value of true means enable IP forwarding.

       option irc-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The IRC server option specifies a list of IRC servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of pref‐
         erence.

       option loader-configfile text

         This option is used to specify a boot loading configuration file a PXE client should use.

         This option is included based on RFC 5071.

       option loader-pathprefix text

         This option is used to specify a path prefix a PXE client should use in conjunction with the boot load configuration file.

         This option is included based on RFC 5071.

       option loader-reboottime uint32

         This  option  is used to dictate the maximum amount of time a PXE client should allow itself to achieve configured network
         resources before rebooting.

         This option is included based on RFC 5071.

       option log-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The log-server option specifies a list of MIT-LCS UDP log servers available to the client.  Servers should  be  listed  in
         order of preference.

       option lpr-servers ip-address  [, ip-address...  ];

         The LPR server option specifies a list of RFC 1179 line printer servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed
         in order of preference.

       option mask-supplier flag;

         This option specifies whether or not the client should respond to subnet mask requests using ICMP.  A value of false indi‐
         cates that the client should not respond.  A value of true means that the client should respond.

       option max-dgram-reassembly uint16;

         This option specifies the maximum size datagram that the client should be prepared to reassemble.  The minimum legal value
         is 576.

       option merit-dump text;

         This option specifies the path-name of a file to which the client's core image should be dumped in the  event  the  client
         crashes.  The path is formatted as a character string consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character set.

       option mobile-ip-home-agent ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         This  option  specifies a list of IP addresses indicating mobile IP home agents available to the client.  Agents should be
         listed in order of preference, although normally there will be only one such agent.

       option name-service-search uint16 [, uint6... ];

         This option specifies a list of name services in the order the client should attempt to use them.

         This option is included based on RFC 2937.

       option nds-context string;

         The nds-context option specifies the name of the initial Netware Directory Service for an NDS client.

       option nds-servers ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The nds-servers option specifies a list of IP addresses of NDS servers.

       option nds-tree-name string;

         The nds-tree-name option specifies NDS tree name that the NDS client should use.

       option netbios-dd-server ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The NetBIOS datagram distribution server (NBDD) option specifies a list of RFC 1001/1002 NBDD servers listed in  order  of
         preference.

       option netbios-name-servers ip-address [, ip-address...];

         The  NetBIOS  name server (NBNS) option specifies a list of RFC 1001/1002 NBNS name servers listed in order of preference.
         NetBIOS Name Service is currently more commonly referred to as WINS.  WINS servers can be  specified  using  the  netbios-
         name-servers option.

       option netbios-node-type uint8;

         The  NetBIOS  node  type option allows NetBIOS over TCP/IP clients which are configurable to be configured as described in
         RFC 1001/1002.  The value is specified as a single octet which identifies the client type.

         Possible node types are:

         1    B-node: Broadcast - no WINS

         2    P-node: Peer - WINS only

         4    M-node: Mixed - broadcast, then WINS

         8    H-node: Hybrid - WINS, then broadcast

       option netbios-scope string;

         The NetBIOS scope option specifies the NetBIOS over TCP/IP scope parameter for the client as specified in  RFC  1001/1002.
         See RFC1001, RFC1002, and RFC1035 for character-set restrictions.

       option netinfo-server-address ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The  netinfo-server-address option has not been described in any RFC, but has been allocated (and is claimed to be in use)
         by Apple Computers.  It's hard to say if the above is the correct format, or what clients might be expected to do if  val‐
         ues were configured.  Use at your own risk.

       option netinfo-server-tag text;

         The  netinfo-server-tag  option has not been described in any RFC, but has been allocated (and is claimed to be in use) by
         Apple Computers.  It's hard to say if the above is the correct format, or what clients might be expected to do  if  values
         were configured.  Use at your own risk.

       option nis-domain text;

         This  option specifies the name of the client's NIS (Sun Network Information Services) domain.  The domain is formatted as
         a character string consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character set.

       option nis-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating NIS servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed  in
         order of preference.

       option nisplus-domain text;

         This  option  specifies the name of the client's NIS+ domain.  The domain is formatted as a character string consisting of
         characters from the NVT ASCII character set.

       option nisplus-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating NIS+ servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in
         order of preference.

       option nntp-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The  NNTP  server  option  specifies a list of NNTP servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of
         preference.

       option non-local-source-routing flag;

         This option specifies whether the client should configure its IP layer to allow forwarding  of  datagrams  with  non-local
         source  routes  (see  Section 3.3.5 of [4] for a discussion of this topic).  A value of false means disallow forwarding of
         such datagrams, and a value of true means allow forwarding.

       option ntp-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating NTP (RFC 5905) servers available to the client.  Servers should be
         listed in order of preference.

       option nwip-domain string;

         The name of the NetWare/IP domain that a NetWare/IP client should use.

       option nwip-suboptions string;

         A sequence of suboptions for NetWare/IP clients - see RFC2242 for details.  Normally this option is set by specifying spe‐
         cific NetWare/IP suboptions - see the NETWARE/IP SUBOPTIONS section for more information.

       option pxe-system-type uint16 [, uint16 ... ];

         A list of one ore more 16-bit integers which allows a client to specify its pre-boot architecture type(s).

         This option is included based on RFC 4578.

       option pxe-interface-id uint8 uint8 uint8

         A three octet value which allows a client to specify its network interface type.

         This option is included based on RFC 4578.

       option pxe-client-id uint8 string

         A single octet indicating type, followed by a string that allows a client to specify its PXE client identity.

         This option is included based on RFC 4578.

       option option-6rd uint8 uint8 ip6-address ip-address [, ip-address ...];

         This option contains information about the rapid deployment option.  It is 8 bits of ipv4 mask length, 8 bits of 6rd  pre‐
         fix length, an ipv6 prefix as an ipv6 address and a list of one or more ipv4 addresses.

         This option is included based on RFC 5969.

       option pana-agent ip-address [, ip-address ... ] ;

         A set of IPv4 addresses of a PAA for the client to use.  The addresses are listed in preferred order.

         This option is included based on RFC 5192.

       option path-mtu-aging-timeout uint32;

         This  option  specifies  the timeout (in seconds) to use when aging Path MTU values discovered by the mechanism defined in
         RFC 1191.

       option path-mtu-plateau-table uint16 [, uint16...  ];

         This option specifies a table of MTU sizes to use when performing Path MTU Discovery as defined in RFC 1191.  The table is
         formatted  as  a  list  of  16-bit  unsigned  integers, ordered from smallest to largest.  The minimum MTU value cannot be
         smaller than 68.

       option pcode text;

         This option specifies a string suitable for the TZ variable.

         This option is included based on RFC 4833.

       option perform-mask-discovery flag;

         This option specifies whether or not the client should perform subnet mask discovery using ICMP.  A value of  false  indi‐
         cates  that  the client should not perform mask discovery.  A value of true means that the client should perform mask dis‐
         covery.

       option policy-filter ip-address ip-address
                         [, ip-address ip-address...];

         This option specifies policy filters for non-local source routing.  The filters consist of a  list  of  IP  addresses  and
         masks which specify destination/mask pairs with which to filter incoming source routes.

         Any source routed datagram whose next-hop address does not match one of the filters should be discarded by the client.

         See STD 3 (RFC1122) for further information.

       option pop-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The  POP3  server  option  specifies a list of POP3 servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of
         preference.

       option rdnss-selection uint8 ip-address ip-address domain-name;

         The rdnss-selection option specifies an 8 bit flags field, a primary and secondary ip address for the name  server  and  a
         domainlist of domains for which the RDNSS has special knowledge.

         This option is included based on RFC 6731.

       option resource-location-servers ip-address
                                     [, ip-address...];

         This  option  specifies  a list of RFC 887 Resource Location servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in
         order of preference.

       option root-path text;

         This option specifies the path-name that contains the client's root disk.  The path is formatted  as  a  character  string
         consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character set.

       option router-discovery flag;

         This option specifies whether or not the client should solicit routers using the Router Discovery mechanism defined in RFC
         1256.  A value of false indicates that the client should not perform router discovery.  A value of  true  means  that  the
         client should perform router discovery.

       option router-solicitation-address ip-address;

         This option specifies the address to which the client should transmit router solicitation requests.

       option routers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The routers option specifies a list of IP addresses for routers on the client's subnet.  Routers should be listed in order
         of preference.

       option slp-directory-agent boolean ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         This option specifies two things: the IP addresses of one or more Service Location Protocol Directory Agents, and  whether
         the  use  of these addresses is mandatory.  If the initial boolean value is true, the SLP agent should just use the IP ad‐
         dresses given.  If the value is false, the SLP agent may additionally do active or  passive  multicast  discovery  of  SLP
         agents (see RFC2165 for details).

         Please note that in this option and the slp-service-scope option, the term "SLP Agent" is being used to refer to a Service
         Location Protocol agent running on a machine that is being configured using the DHCP protocol.

         Also, please be aware that some companies may refer to SLP as NDS.  If you have an NDS directory agent whose  address  you
         need to configure, the slp-directory-agent option should work.

       option slp-service-scope boolean text;

         The Service Location Protocol Service Scope Option specifies two things: a list of service scopes for SLP, and whether the
         use of this list is mandatory.  If the initial boolean value is true, the SLP agent should only use  the  list  of  scopes
         provided in this option; otherwise, it may use its own static configuration in preference to the list provided in this op‐
         tion.

         The text string should be a comma-separated list of scopes that the SLP agent should use.  It may  be  omitted,  in  which
         case the SLP Agent will use the aggregated list of scopes of all directory agents known to the SLP agent.

       option smtp-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The  SMTP  server  option  specifies a list of SMTP servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of
         preference.

       option static-routes ip-address ip-address
                         [, ip-address ip-address...];

         This option specifies a list of static routes that the client should install in its routing cache.  If multiple routes  to
         the same destination are specified, they are listed in descending order of priority.

         The routes consist of a list of IP address pairs.  The first address is the destination address, and the second address is
         the router for the destination.

         The default route (0.0.0.0) is an illegal destination for a static route.  To specify the default route, use  the  routers
         option.   Also, please note that this option is not intended for classless IP routing - it does not include a subnet mask.
         Since classless IP routing is now the most widely deployed routing standard, this option is virtually useless, and is  not
         implemented by any of the popular DHCP clients, for example the Microsoft DHCP client.

       option streettalk-directory-assistance-server ip-address
                                                  [, ip-address...];

         The  StreetTalk  Directory  Assistance  (STDA)  server  option  specifies  a list of STDA servers available to the client.
         Servers should be listed in order of preference.

       option streettalk-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The StreetTalk server option specifies a list of StreetTalk servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed  in
         order of preference.

       option subnet-mask ip-address;

         The  subnet  mask option specifies the client's subnet mask as per RFC 950.  If no subnet mask option is provided anywhere
         in scope, as a last resort dhcpd will use the subnet mask from the subnet declaration for the network on which an  address
         is being assigned.  However, any subnet-mask option declaration that is in scope for the address being assigned will over‐
         ride the subnet mask specified in the subnet declaration.

       option subnet-selection ip-address;

         Sent by the client if an address is required in a subnet other than the one that would normally be selected (based on  the
         relaying  address  of the connected subnet the request is obtained from). See RFC3011. Note that the option number used by
         this server is 118; this has not always been the defined number, and some clients may use a different value. Use  of  this
         option should be regarded as slightly experimental!

       This option is not user configurable in the server.

       option swap-server ip-address;

         This specifies the IP address of the client's swap server.

       option tftp-server-address ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         This option configures a list of one or more IPv4 addresses of tftp servers a client may use.

         This option is included based on RFC 5859

       option tcp-keepalive-garbage flag;

         This  option  specifies whether or not the client should send TCP keepalive messages with an octet of garbage for compati‐
         bility with older implementations.  A value of false indicates that a garbage octet should not be sent. A  value  of  true
         indicates that a garbage octet should be sent.

       option tcp-keepalive-interval uint32;

         This  option  specifies  the interval (in seconds) that the client TCP should wait before sending a keepalive message on a
         TCP connection.  The time is specified as a 32-bit unsigned integer.  A value of zero indicates that the client should not
         generate keepalive messages on connections unless specifically requested by an application.

       option tcode text;

         This option specifies a name of a zone entry in the TZ database.

         This option is included based on RFC 4833.

       option tftp-server-name text;

         This  option is used to identify a TFTP server and, if supported by the client, should have the same effect as the server-
         name declaration.  BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.  Some DHCP clients will support it, and others actu‐
         ally require it.

       option time-offset int32;

         The time-offset option specifies the offset of the client's subnet in seconds from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       option time-servers ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         The  time-server option specifies a list of RFC 868 time servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in or‐
         der of preference.

       option trailer-encapsulation flag;

         This option specifies whether or not the client should negotiate the use of trailers (RFC 893 [14])  when  using  the  ARP
         protocol.   A value of false indicates that the client should not attempt to use trailers.  A value of true means that the
         client should attempt to use trailers.

       option uap-servers text;

         This option specifies a list of URLs, each pointing to a user authentication service that is capable of processing authen‐
         tication requests encapsulated in the User Authentication Protocol (UAP).  UAP servers can accept either HTTP 1.1 or SSLv3
         connections.  If the list includes a URL that does not contain a port component, the normal default port is assumed (i.e.,
         port  80  for  http  and port 443 for https).  If the list includes a URL that does not contain a path component, the path
         /uap is assumed.  If more than one URL is specified in this list, the URLs are separated by spaces.

       option user-class string;

         This option is used by some DHCP clients as a way for users to specify identifying information to the client.  This can be
         used in a similar way to the vendor-class-identifier option, but the value of the option is specified by the user, not the
         vendor.  Most recent DHCP clients have a way in the user interface to specify the value for this identifier, usually as  a
         text string.

       option v4-access-domain domain-name;

         The domain name associated with the access network for use with LIS Discovery.

         This option is included based on RFC 5986.

       option v4-lost domain-name;

         The domain name of the LoST server for the client to use.

         This option is included based on RFC 5223.

       option v6-only-preferred uint32;

         The number of seconds the client should disable DHCPv4 for.

         This option and its use by the client are specified in RFC 8925.

       option vendor-class-identifier string;

         This option is used by some DHCP clients to identify the vendor type and possibly the configuration of a DHCP client.  The
         information is a string of bytes whose contents are specific to the vendor and are not specified in a  standard.   To  see
         what vendor class identifier clients are sending, you can write the following in your DHCP server configuration file:

         set vendor-string = option vendor-class-identifier;

         This  will  result in all entries in the DHCP server lease database file for clients that sent vendor-class-identifier op‐
         tions having a set statement that looks something like this:

         set vendor-string = "SUNW.Ultra-5_10";

         The vendor-class-identifier option is normally used by the DHCP server to determine the options that are returned  in  the
         vendor-encapsulated-options option.  Please see the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later in this manual page for fur‐
         ther information.

       option vendor-encapsulated-options string;

         The vendor-encapsulated-options option can contain either a single vendor-specific value or one  or  more  vendor-specific
         suboptions.   This option is not normally specified in the DHCP server configuration file - instead, a vendor class is de‐
         fined for each vendor, vendor class suboptions are defined, values for those suboptions are defined, and the  DHCP  server
         makes up a response on that basis.

         Some default behaviours for well-known DHCP client vendors (currently, the Microsoft Windows 2000 DHCP client) are config‐
         ured automatically, but otherwise this must be configured manually - see the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later  in
         this manual page for details.

       option vivso string;

         The  vivso  option can contain multiple separate options, one for each 32-bit Enterprise ID.  Each Enterprise-ID discrimi‐
         nated option then contains additional options whose format is defined by the vendor who holds that  ID.   This  option  is
         usually  not configured manually, but rather is configured via intervening option definitions.  Please also see the VENDOR
         ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later in this manual page for details.

       option www-server ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         The WWW server option specifies a list of WWW servers available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of pref‐
         erence.

       option x-display-manager ip-address [, ip-address...  ];

         This  option  specifies  a  list  of systems that are running the X Window System Display Manager and are available to the
         client.  Addresses should be listed in order of preference.

RELAY AGENT INFORMATION OPTION
       An IETF draft, draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-11.txt, defines a series of encapsulated options that a relay agent can add to a
       DHCP  packet  when relaying it to the DHCP server.  The server can then make address allocation decisions (or whatever other
       decisions it wants) based on these options.  The server also returns these options in any replies it sends through the relay
       agent, so that the relay agent can use the information in these options for delivery or accounting purposes.

       The  current  draft  defines  two  options.   To  reference these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space name,
       "agent", followed by a period, followed by the option name.  It is not normally useful to define values for these options in
       the server, although it is permissible.  These options are not supported in the client.

       option agent.circuit-id string;

         The  circuit-id  suboption  encodes an agent-local identifier of the circuit from which a DHCP client-to-server packet was
         received.  It is intended for use by agents in relaying DHCP responses back to the proper circuit.  The format of this op‐
         tion is currently defined to be vendor-dependent, and will probably remain that way, although the current draft allows for
         the possibility of standardizing the format in the future.

       option agent.remote-id string;

         The remote-id suboption encodes information about the remote host end of a circuit.  Examples of what it might contain in‐
         clude  caller ID information, username information, remote ATM address, cable modem ID, and similar things.  In principal,
         the meaning is not well-specified, and it should generally be assumed to be an  opaque  object  that  is  administratively
         guaranteed to be unique to a particular remote end of a circuit.

       option agent.DOCSIS-device-class uint32;

         The  DOCSIS-device-class suboption is intended to convey information about the host endpoint, hardware, and software, that
         either the host operating system or the DHCP server may not otherwise be aware of (but the relay is able to  distinguish).
         This  is  implemented as a 32-bit field (4 octets), each bit representing a flag describing the host in one of these ways.
         So far, only bit zero (being the least significant bit) is defined in RFC3256.  If this bit is set to  one,  the  host  is
         considered a CPE Controlled Cable Modem (CCCM).  All other bits are reserved.

       option agent.link-selection ip-address;

         The link-selection suboption is provided by relay agents to inform servers what subnet the client is actually attached to.
         This is useful in those cases where the giaddr (where responses must be sent to the relay agent) is not on the same subnet
         as  the client.  When this option is present in a packet from a relay agent, the DHCP server will use its contents to find
         a subnet declared in configuration, and from here take one step further backwards to any shared-network the subnet may  be
         defined within; the client may be given any address within that shared network, as normally appropriate.

THE CLIENT FQDN SUBOPTIONS
       The Client FQDN option, currently defined in the Internet Draft draft-ietf-dhc-fqdn-option-00.txt is not a standard yet, but
       is in sufficiently wide use already that we have implemented it.  Due to the complexity of the option format, we have imple‐
       mented  it  as a suboption space rather than a single option.  In general this option should not be configured by the user -
       instead it should be used as part of an automatic DNS update system.

       option fqdn.no-client-update flag;

         When the client sends this, if it is true, it means the client will not attempt to update its A record.  When sent by  the
         server to the client, it means that the client should not update its own A record.

       option fqdn.server-update flag;

         When  the client sends this to the server, it is requesting that the server update its A record.  When sent by the server,
         it means that the server has updated (or is about to update) the client's A record.

       option fqdn.encoded flag;

         If true, this indicates that the domain name included in the option is encoded in DNS wire format, rather  than  as  plain
         ASCII  text.  The client normally sets this to false if it doesn't support DNS wire format in the FQDN option.  The server
         should always send back the same value that the client sent.  When this value is set on the configuration  side,  it  con‐
         trols the format in which the fqdn.fqdn suboption is encoded.

       option fqdn.rcode1 flag;

       option fqdn.rcode2 flag;

         These  options  specify  the  result  of the updates of the A and PTR records, respectively, and are only sent by the DHCP
         server to the DHCP client.  The values of these fields are those defined in the DNS protocol specification.

       option fqdn.fqdn text;

         Specifies the domain name that the client wishes to use.  This can be a fully-qualified domain name, or  a  single  label.
         If  there  is  no trailing ´.´ character in the name, it is not fully-qualified, and the server will generally update that
         name in some locally-defined domain.

       option fqdn.hostname --never set--;

         This option should never be set, but it can be read back using the option and config-option operators in an expression, in
         which  case  it  returns the first label in the fqdn.fqdn suboption - for example, if the value of fqdn.fqdn is "foo.exam‐
         ple.com.", then fqdn.hostname will be "foo".

       option fqdn.domainname --never set--;

         This option should never be set, but it can be read back using the option and config-option operators in an expression, in
         which case it returns all labels after the first label in the fqdn.fqdn suboption - for example, if the value of fqdn.fqdn
         is "foo.example.com.", then fqdn.domainname will be "example.com.".  If this suboption value is not set, it means that  an
         unqualified name was sent in the fqdn option, or that no fqdn option was sent at all.

       If  you  wish to use any of these suboptions, we strongly recommend that you refer to the Client FQDN option draft (or stan‐
       dard, when it becomes a standard) - the documentation here is sketchy and incomplete in comparison, and is just intended for
       reference by people who already understand the Client FQDN option specification.

THE NETWARE/IP SUBOPTIONS
       RFC2242 defines a set of encapsulated options for Novell NetWare/IP clients.  To use these options in the dhcp server, spec‐
       ify the option space name, "nwip", followed by a period, followed by the option name.  The following options can  be  speci‐
       fied:

       option nwip.nsq-broadcast flag;

         If  true, the client should use the NetWare Nearest Server Query to locate a NetWare/IP server.  The behaviour of the Nov‐
         ell client if this suboption is false, or is not present, is not specified.

       option nwip.preferred-dss ip-address [, ip-address... ];

         This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP addresses, each of which should be the IP address  of  a  NetWare  Domain
         SAP/RIP server (DSS).

       option nwip.nearest-nwip-server ip-address
                                    [, ip-address...];

         This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP addresses, each of which should be the IP address of a Nearest NetWare IP
         server.

       option nwip.autoretries uint8;

         Specifies the number of times that a NetWare/IP client should attempt to communicate with a given DSS server at startup.

       option nwip.autoretry-secs uint8;

         Specifies the number of seconds that a Netware/IP client should wait between retries when attempting to establish communi‐
         cations with a DSS server at startup.

       option nwip.nwip-1-1 uint8;

         If  true,  the  NetWare/IP  client should support NetWare/IP version 1.1 compatibility.  This is only needed if the client
         will be contacting Netware/IP version 1.1 servers.

       option nwip.primary-dss ip-address;

         Specifies the IP address of the Primary Domain SAP/RIP Service server (DSS) for this NetWare/IP  domain.   The  NetWare/IP
         administration utility uses this value as Primary DSS server when configuring a secondary DSS server.

STANDARD DHCPV6 OPTIONS
       DHCPv6  options  differ from DHCPv4 options partially due to using 16-bit code and length tags, but semantically zero-length
       options are legal in DHCPv6, and multiple options are treated differently.  Whereas in DHCPv4 multiple options would be con‐
       catenated to form one option, in DHCPv6 they are expected to be individual instantiations.  Understandably, many options are
       not "allowed" to have multiple instances in a packet - normally these are options which are digested by  the  DHCP  protocol
       software, and not by users or applications.

       option dhcp6.client-id string;

         This  option  specifies  the  client's  DUID identifier.  DUIDs are similar but different from DHCPv4 client identifiers -
         there are documented duid types:

         duid-llt

         duid-en

         duid-ll

         This value should not be configured, but rather is provided by clients and treated as an opaque  identifier  key  blob  by
         servers.

       option dhcp6.server-id string;

         This  option  specifies the server's DUID identifier.  One may use this option to configure an opaque binary blob for your
         server's identifier.

       option dhcp6.ia-na string;

         The Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses (ia-na) carries assigned addresses that are not  temporary  addresses
         for use by the DHCPv6 client.  This option is produced by the DHCPv6 server software, and should not be configured.

       option dhcp6.ia-ta string;

         The Identity Association for Temporary Addresses (ia-ta) carries temporary addresses, which may change upon every renewal.
         There is no support for this in the current DHCPv6 software.

       option dhcp6.ia-addr string;

         The Identity Association Address option is encapsulated inside ia-na or ia-ta options in order to represent addresses  as‐
         sociated with those IA's.  These options are manufactured by the software, so should not be configured.

       option dhcp6.oro uint16 [ , uint16, ... ];

         The  Option  Request Option ("ORO") is the DHCPv6 equivalent of the parameter-request-list.  Clients supply this option to
         ask servers to reply with options relevant to their needs and use.  This option must not be directly configured,  the  re‐
         quest syntax in dhclient.conf (5) should be used instead.

       option dhcp6.preference uint8;

         The  preference  option informs a DHCPv6 client which server is ´preferred´ for use on a given subnet.  This preference is
         only applied during the initial stages of configuration - once a client is bound to an IA, it will remain bound to that IA
         until  it  is  no  longer valid or has expired.  This value may be configured on the server, and is digested by the client
         software.

       option dhcp6.elapsed-time uint16;

         The elapsed-time option is constructed by the DHCPv6 client software, and is potentially consumed by intermediaries.  This
         option should not be configured.

       option dhcp6.relay-msg string;

         The  relay-msg option is constructed by intervening DHCPv6 relay agent software.  This option is entirely used by protocol
         software, and is not meant for user configuration.

       option dhcp6.unicast ip6-address;

         The unicast option is provided by DHCPv6 servers which are willing (or prefer) to receive Request, Renew, Decline, and Re‐
         lease  packets from their clients via unicast.  Normally, DHCPv6 clients will multicast these messages.  Per RFC 3315, the
         server will reject a unicast message received from a client unless it previously sent (or would have sent) the unicast op‐
         tion  to that client.  This option may be configured on the server at the global and shared network level.  When a unicast
         message is received, the server will check for an applicable definition of the unicast option.  If such an option is found
         the message will be accepted, if not it will be rejected.

       option dhcp6.status-code status-code [ string ] ;

         The  status-code option is provided by DHCPv6 servers to inform clients of error conditions during protocol communication.
         This option is manufactured and digested by protocol software, and should not be configured.

       option dhcp6.rapid-commit ;

         The rapid-commit option is a zero-length option that clients use to indicate their desire to enter into rapid-commit  with
         the server.

       option dhcp6.vendor-opts string;

         The  vendor-opts  option  is  actually  an encapsulated sub-option space, in which each Vendor-specific Information Option
         (VSIO) is identified by a 32-bit Enterprise-ID number.  The encapsulated option spaces within these options are defined by
         the vendors.

         To make use of this option, the best way is to examine the section titled VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS below, in particular
         the bits about the "vsio" option space.

       option dhcp6.interface-id string;

         The interface-id option is manufactured by relay agents, and may be used to guide configuration differentiating clients by
         the interface they are remotely attached to.  It does not make sense to configure a value for this option, but it may make
         sense to inspect its contents.

       option dhcp6.reconf-msg dhcpv6-message;

         The reconf-msg option is manufactured by servers, and sent to clients in Reconfigure messages to inform them of what  mes‐
         sage the client should Reconfigure using.  There is no support for DHCPv6 Reconfigure extensions, and this option is docu‐
         mented informationally only.

       option dhcp6.reconf-accept ;

         The reconf-accept option is included by DHCPv6 clients that support the Reconfigure extensions, advertising that they will
         respond  if  the  server were to ask them to Reconfigure.  There is no support for DHCPv6 Reconfigure extensions, and this
         option is documented informationally only.

       option dhcp6.sip-servers-names domain-list;

         The sip-servers-names option allows SIP clients to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all outbound  SIP  re‐
         quests,  a  so-called"outbound  proxy server."  If you wish to use manually entered IPv6 addresses instead, please see the
         sip-servers-addresses option below.

       option dhcp6.sip-servers-addresses ip6-address [, ip6-address ... ] ;

         The sip-servers-addresses option allows SIP clients to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all  outbound  SIP
         requests,  a  so-called  "outbound proxy servers."  If you wish to use domain names rather than IPv6 addresses, please see
         the sip-servers-names option above.

       option dhcp6.name-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ... ] ;

         The name-servers option instructs clients about locally available recursive DNS servers.  It is easiest to  describe  this
         as the "nameserver" line in /etc/resolv.conf.

       option dhcp6.domain-search domain-list;

         The  domain-search option specifies the client's domain search path to be applied to recursive DNS queries.  It is easiest
         to describe this as the "search" line in /etc/resolv.conf.

       option dhcp6.ia-pd string;

         The ia-pd option is manufactured by clients and servers to create a Prefix Delegation binding - to delegate an IPv6 prefix
         to the client.  It is not directly edited in dhcpd.conf(5) or dhclient.conf(5), but rather is manufactured and consumed by
         the software.

       option dhcp6.ia-prefix string;

         The ia-prefix option is placed inside ia-pd options in order to identify the prefix(es) allocated to the  client.   It  is
         not directly edited in dhcpd.conf(5) or dhclient.conf(5), but rather is manufactured and consumed by the software.

       option dhcp6.nis-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ... ] ;

         The nis-servers option identifies, in order, NIS servers available to the client.

       option dhcp6.nisp-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ... ] ;

         The nisp-servers option identifies, in order, NIS+ servers available to the client.

       option nis-domain-name domain-list;

         The  nis-domain-name option specifies the NIS domain name the client is expected to use, and is related to the nis-servers
         option.

       option dhcp6.nis-domain-name domain-name;

         The dhcp6.nis-domain-name option specifies NIS domain name the client is expected to use, and  is  related  to  dhcp6.nis-
         servers option.

       option nisp-domain-name domain-list;

         The  nisp-domain-name  option  specifies  the  NIS+ domain name the client is expected to use, and is related to the nisp-
         servers option.

       option dhcp6.nisp-domain-name domain-name;

         The dhcp6.nis-domain-name option specifies NIS+ domain name the client is expected to use, and is related  to  dhcp6.nisp-
         servers option.

       option dhcp6.sntp-servers ip6-address [, ip6-address ... ] ;

         The sntp-servers option specifies a list of local SNTP servers available for the client to synchronize their clocks.

       option dhcp6.info-refresh-time uint32;

         The info-refresh-time option gives DHCPv6 clients using Information-request messages a hint as to how long they should be‐
         tween refreshing the information they were given.  Note that this option will only be delivered  to  the  client,  and  be
         likely to affect the client's behaviour, if the client requested the option.

       option dhcp6.bcms-server-d domain-list;

         The  bcms-server-d  option  contains the domain names of local BCMS (Broadcast and Multicast Control Services) controllers
         which the client may use.

       option dhcp6.bcms-server-a ip6-address [, ip6-address ... ] ;

         The bcms-server-a option contains the IPv6 addresses of local BCMS (Broadcast and Multicast Control Services)  controllers
         which the client may use.

       option dhcp6.geoconf-civic string;

         A string to hold the geoconf civic structure.

         This option is included based on RFC 4776.

       option dhcp6.remote-id string;

         The  remote-id  option  is constructed by relay agents, to inform the server of details pertaining to what the relay knows
         about the client (such as what port it is attached to, and so forth).  The contents of this option have  some  vendor-spe‐
         cific structure (similar to VSIO), but we have chosen to treat this option as an opaque field.

       option dhcp6.subscriber-id string;

         The  subscriber-id  option is an opaque field provided by the relay agent, which provides additional information about the
         subscriber in question.  The exact contents of this option depend upon the vendor and/or the operator's  configuration  of
         the remote device, and as such is an opaque field.

       option dhcp6.fqdn string;

         The  fqdn option is normally constructed by the client or server, and negotiates the client's Fully Qualified Domain Name,
         as well as which party is responsible for Dynamic DNS Updates.  See the section on the Client FQDN SubOptions for full de‐
         tails (the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 FQDN options use the same "fqdn." encapsulated space, so are in all ways identical).

       option dhcp6.pana-agent ip6-address [, ip6-address ... ] ;

         A set of IPv6 addresses of a PAA for the client to use.  The addresses are listed in preferred order.

         This option is included based on RFC 5192.

ACCESSING DHCPV6 RELAY OPTIONS
       v6relay (relay-number, option) This option allows access to an option that has been added to a packet by a relay agent.  Re‐
       lay-number  value  selects the relay to examine and option is the option to find.  In DHCPv6 each relay encapsulates the en‐
       tire previous message into an option, adds its own options (if any) and sends the result onwards.  The RFC specifies a limit
       of  32  hops.   A  relay-number  of  0 is a no-op and means don't look at the relays.  1 is the relay that is closest to the
       client, 2 would be the next in from the client and so on.  Any value greater than the max number of hops is which is closest
       to the server independent of number.  To use this option in a class statement you would have something like this:

       match if v6relay(1, option dhcp6.subscriber-id) = "client_1";

DEFINING NEW OPTIONS
       The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client and server provide the capability to define new options.  Each DHCP option has a
       name, a code, and a structure.  The name is used by you to refer to the option.  The code is a  number,  used  by  the  DHCP
       server and client to refer to an option.  The structure describes what the contents of an option looks like.

       To  define  a new option, you need to choose a name for it that is not in use for some other option - for example, you can't
       use "host-name" because the DHCP protocol already defines a host-name option, which is documented  earlier  in  this  manual
       page.   If an option name doesn't appear in this manual page, you can use it, but it's probably a good idea to put some kind
       of unique string at the beginning so you can be sure that future options don't take your name.  For example, you  might  de‐
       fine an option, "local-host-name", feeling some confidence that no official DHCP option name will ever start with "local".

       Once  you  have  chosen a name, you must choose a code.  All codes between 224 and 254 are reserved as ´site-local´ DHCP op‐
       tions, so you can pick any one of these for your site (not for your product/application).  In RFC3942, site-local space  was
       moved  from  starting at 128 to starting at 224.  In practice, some vendors have interpreted the protocol rather loosely and
       have used option code values greater than 128 themselves.  There's no real way to avoid this problem, and it was thought  to
       be  unlikely to cause too much trouble in practice.  If you come across a vendor-documented option code in either the new or
       old site-local spaces, please contact your vendor and inform them about rfc3942.

       The structure of an option is simply the format in which the option data appears.  The ISC DHCP server currently supports  a
       few  simple  types,  like integers, booleans, strings and IP addresses, and it also supports the ability to define arrays of
       single types or arrays of fixed sequences of types.

       New options are declared as follows:

       option new-name code new-code = definition ;

       The values of new-name and new-code should be the name you have chosen for the new option and the code you have chosen.  The
       definition should be the definition of the structure of the option.

       The following simple option type definitions are supported:

       BOOLEAN

       option new-name code new-code = boolean ;

       An  option  of type boolean is a flag with a value of either on or off (or true or false).  So an example use of the boolean
       type would be:

       option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean;
       option use-zephyr on;

       INTEGER

       option new-name code new-code = sign integer width ;

       The sign token should either be blank, unsigned or signed.  The width can be either 8, 16 or 32, and refers to the number of
       bits  in  the  integer.   So for example, the following two lines show a definition of the sql-connection-max option and its
       use:

       option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer 16;
       option sql-connection-max 1536;

       IP-ADDRESS

       option new-name code new-code = ip-address ;

       An option whose structure is an IP address can be expressed either as a domain name or as a dotted quad.  So  the  following
       is an example use of the ip-address type:

       option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address;
       option sql-server-address sql.example.com;

       IP6-ADDRESS

       option new-name code new-code = ip6-address ;

       An  option whose structure is an IPv6 address must be expressed as a valid IPv6 address.  The following is an example use of
       the ip6-address type:

       option dhcp6.some-server code 1234 = array of ip6-address;
       option dhcp6.some-server 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1, 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::2;

       TEXT

       option new-name code new-code = text ;

       An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text string.  For example:

       option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
       option sql-default-connection-name "PRODZA";

       DATA STRING

       option new-name code new-code = string ;

       An option whose type is a data string is essentially just a collection of bytes, and can be specified either as quoted text,
       like the text type, or as a list of hexadecimal contents separated by colons whose values must be between 0 and FF.  For ex‐
       ample:

       option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
       option sql-identification-token 17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;

       DOMAIN-LIST

       option new-name code new-code = domain-list [compressed] ;

       An option whose type is domain-list is an RFC1035 formatted (on the wire, "DNS Format") list of domain names,  separated  by
       root  labels.  The optional compressed keyword indicates if the option should be compressed relative to the start of the op‐
       tion contents (not the packet contents).

       When in doubt, omit the compressed keyword.  When the software receives an option that is compressed and the compressed key‐
       word  is  omitted,  it  will still decompress the option (relative to the option contents field).  The keyword only controls
       whether or not transmitted packets are compressed.

       Note that when domain-list formatted options are output as environment variables to  dhclient-script(8),  the  standard  DNS
       -escape mechanism is used: they are decimal.  This is appropriate for direct use in eg /etc/resolv.conf.

       ENCAPSULATION

       option new-name code new-code = encapsulate identifier ;

       An  option whose type is encapsulate will encapsulate the contents of the option space specified in identifier.  Examples of
       encapsulated options in the DHCP protocol as it currently exists include the vendor-encapsulated-options  option,  the  net‐
       ware-suboptions option and the relay-agent-information option.

       option space local;
       option local.demo code 1 = text;
       option local-encapsulation code 197 = encapsulate local;
       option local.demo "demo";

       ARRAYS

       Options  can contain arrays of any of the above types except for the text and data string types, which aren't currently sup‐
       ported in arrays.  An example of an array definition is as follows:

       option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
       option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;

       RECORDS

       Options can also contain data structures consisting of a sequence of data types, which is sometimes called  a  record  type.
       For example:

       option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32, text };
       option contrived-001 on 1772 "contrivance";

       It's also possible to have options that are arrays of records, for example:

       option new-static-routes code 201 = array of {
            ip-address, ip-address, ip-address, integer 8 };
       option static-routes
            10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 net-0-rtr.example.com 1,
            10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 net-1-rtr.example.com 1,
            10.2.0.0 255.255.224.0 net-2-0-rtr.example.com 3;

VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS
       The DHCP protocol defines the vendor-encapsulated-options option, which allows vendors to define their own options that will
       be sent encapsulated in a standard DHCP option.  It also defines the Vendor Identified Vendor Sub Options option  ("VIVSO"),
       and the DHCPv6 protocol defines the Vendor-specific Information Option ("VSIO").  The format of all of these options is usu‐
       ally internally a string of options, similarly to other normal DHCP options.  The VIVSO and VSIO options differ in that they
       contain  options that correspond to vendor Enterprise-ID numbers (assigned by IANA), which then contain options according to
       each Vendor's specifications.  You will need to refer to your vendor's documentation in order to form options to their spec‐
       ification.

       The  value  of  these  options can be set in one of two ways.  The first way is to simply specify the data directly, using a
       text string or a colon-separated list of hexadecimal values.  For help in forming these strings, please refer to RFC2132 for
       the  DHCPv4  Vendor Specific Information Option, RFC3925 for the DHCPv4 Vendor Identified Vendor Sub Options, or RFC3315 for
       the DHCPv6 Vendor-specific Information Option.  For example:

       option vendor-encapsulated-options
           2:4:
            AC:11:41:1:
           3:12:
            73:75:6e:64:68:63:70:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:31:37:2d:31:
           4:12:
            2f:65:78:70:6f:72:74:2f:72:6f:6f:74:2f:69:38:36:70:63;
       option vivso
           00:00:09:bf:0E:
            01:0c:
                48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;
       option dhcp6.vendor-opts
           00:00:09:bf:
            00:01:00:0c:
                48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;

       The second way of setting the value of these options is to have the DHCP server generate a  vendor-specific  option  buffer.
       To  do  this,  you must do four things: define an option space, define some options in that option space, provide values for
       them, and specify that that option space should be used to generate the relevant option.

       To define a new option space in which vendor options can be stored, use the option space statement:

       option space name [ [ code width number ] [ length width number ] [ hash size number ] ] ;

       Where the numbers following code width, length width, and hash size respectively identify the number of bytes  used  to  de‐
       scribe  option  codes, option lengths, and the size in buckets of the hash tables to hold options in this space (most DHCPv4
       option spaces use 1 byte codes and lengths, which is the default, whereas most DHCPv6 option spaces use  2  byte  codes  and
       lengths).

       The code and length widths are used in DHCP protocol - you must configure these numbers to match the applicable option space
       you are configuring.  They each default to 1.  Valid values for code widths are 1, 2 or 4.  Valid values for  length  widths
       are  0,  1  or  2.  Most DHCPv4 option spaces use 1 byte codes and lengths, which is the default, whereas most DHCPv6 option
       spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths.  A zero-byte length produces options similar to the DHCPv6 Vendor-specific  Information
       Option - but not their contents!

       The hash size defaults depend upon the code width selected, and may be 254 or 1009.  Valid values range between 1 and 65535.
       Note that the higher you configure this value, the more memory will be used.  It is considered good practice to configure  a
       value  that  is  slightly larger than the estimated number of options you plan to configure within the space.  Previous ver‐
       sions of ISC DHCP (up to and including DHCP 3.0.*), this value was fixed at 9973.

       The name can then be used in option definitions, as described earlier in this document.  For example:

       option space SUNW code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
       option SUNW.server-address code 2 = ip-address;
       option SUNW.server-name code 3 = text;
       option SUNW.root-path code 4 = text;

       option space ISC code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
       option ISC.sample code 1 = text;
       option vendor.ISC code 2495 = encapsulate vivso-sample;
       option vendor-class.ISC code 2495 = text;

       option ISC.sample "configuration text here";
       option vendor-class.ISC "vendor class here";

       option space docsis code width 2 length width 2 hash size 17;
       option docsis.tftp-servers code 32 = array of ip6-address;
       option docsis.cablelabs-configuration-file code 33 = text;
       option docsis.cablelabs-syslog-servers code 34 = array of ip6-address;
       option docsis.device-id code 36 = string;
       option docsis.time-servers code 37 = array of ip6-address;
       option docsis.time-offset code 38 = signed integer 32;
       option vsio.docsis code 4491 = encapsulate docsis;

       Once you have defined an option space and the format of some options, you can set up scopes that define values for those op‐
       tions,  and  you can say when to use them.  For example, suppose you want to handle two different classes of clients.  Using
       the option space definition shown in the previous example, you can send different option values to different  clients  based
       on the vendor-class-identifier option that the clients send, as follows:

       class "vendor-classes" {
         match option vendor-class-identifier;
       }

       subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.Ultra-5_10" {
         vendor-option-space SUNW;
         option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/sparc";
       }

       subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.i86pc" {
         vendor-option-space SUNW;
         option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/i86pc";
       }

       option SUNW.server-address 172.17.65.1;
       option SUNW.server-name "sundhcp-server17-1";

       option vivso-sample.sample "Hello world!";

       option docsis.tftp-servers ::1;

       As you can see in the preceding example, regular scoping rules apply, so you can define values that are global in the global
       scope, and only define values that are specific to a particular class in the local scope.  The vendor-option-space  declara‐
       tion  tells  the DHCP server to use options in the SUNW option space to construct the DHCPv4 vendor-encapsulated-options op‐
       tion.  This is a limitation of that option - the DHCPv4 VIVSO and the DHCPv6 VSIO options can have multiple  vendor  defini‐
       tions all at once (even transmitted to the same client), so it is not necessary to configure this.
