NAME
       ffplay - FFplay media player

SYNOPSIS
       ffplay [options] [input_url]

DESCRIPTION
       FFplay is a very simple and portable media player using the FFmpeg libraries and the SDL library. It is mostly used as a
       testbed for the various FFmpeg APIs.

OPTIONS
       All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string representing a number as input, which may be followed
       by one of the SI unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

       If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples,
       which are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit prefix multiplies the value by 8.
       This allows using, for example: 'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

       Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the corresponding value to true. They can be set to false
       by prefixing the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo" will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.

   Stream specifiers
       Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers are used to precisely specify which stream(s)
       a given option belongs to.

       A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and separated from it by a colon. E.g. "-codec:a:1 ac3"
       contains the "a:1" stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it would select the ac3 codec for the
       second audio stream.

       A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all of them. E.g. the stream specifier in
       "-b:a 128k" matches all audio streams.

       An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, "-codec copy" or "-codec: copy" would copy all the streams
       without reencoding.

       Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

       stream_index
           Matches the stream with this index. E.g. "-threads:1 4" would set the thread count for the second stream to 4. If
           stream_index is used as an additional stream specifier (see below), then it selects stream number stream_index from the
           matching streams. Stream numbering is based on the order of the streams as detected by libavformat except when a program
           ID is also specified. In this case it is based on the ordering of the streams in the program.

       stream_type[:additional_stream_specifier]
           stream_type is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's' for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for
           attachments. 'v' matches all video streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video
           thumbnails or cover arts. If additional_stream_specifier is used, then it matches streams which both have this type and
           match the additional_stream_specifier. Otherwise, it matches all streams of the specified type.

       p:program_id[:additional_stream_specifier]
           Matches streams which are in the program with the id program_id. If additional_stream_specifier is used, then it matches
           streams which both are part of the program and match the additional_stream_specifier.

       #stream_id or i:stream_id
           Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

       m:key[:value]
           Matches streams with the metadata tag key having the specified value. If value is not given, matches streams that
           contain the given tag with any value.

       u   Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the essential information such as video
           dimension or audio sample rate must be present.

           Note that in ffmpeg, matching by metadata will only work properly for input files.

           Show autodetected sources of the input device.  Some devices may provide system-dependent source names that cannot be
           autodetected.  The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.

                   ffmpeg -sources pulse,server=192.168.0.4

       -sinks device[,opt1=val1[,opt2=val2]...]
           Show autodetected sinks of the output device.  Some devices may provide system-dependent sink names that cannot be
           autodetected.  The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.

                   ffmpeg -sinks pulse,server=192.168.0.4

       -loglevel [flags+]loglevel | -v [flags+]loglevel
           Set logging level and flags used by the library.

           The optional flags prefix can consist of the following values:

           repeat
               Indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed to the first line and the "Last message repeated n
               times" line will be omitted.

           level
               Indicates that log output should add a "[level]" prefix to each message line. This can be used as an alternative to
               log coloring, e.g. when dumping the log to file.

           Flags can also be used alone by adding a '+'/'-' prefix to set/reset a single flag without affecting other flags or
           changing loglevel. When setting both flags and loglevel, a '+' separator is expected between the last flags value and
           before loglevel.

           loglevel is a string or a number containing one of the following values:

           quiet, -8
               Show nothing at all; be silent.

           panic, 0
               Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as an assertion failure. This is not currently
               used for anything.

           fatal, 8
               Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely cannot continue.

           error, 16
               Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

           warning, 24
               Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

           info, 32
               Show informative messages during processing. This is in addition to warnings and errors. This is the default value.

           verbose, 40
               Same as "info", except more verbose.

           debug, 48
               Show everything, including debugging information.

           trace, 56

           For example to enable repeated log output, add the "level" prefix, and set loglevel to "verbose":

                   ffmpeg -loglevel repeat+level+verbose -i input output

           Another example that enables repeated log output without affecting current state of "level" prefix flag or loglevel:

                   ffmpeg [...] -loglevel +repeat

           By default the program logs to stderr. If coloring is supported by the terminal, colors are used to mark errors and
           warnings. Log coloring can be disabled setting the environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR, or can be forced setting
           the environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR.

       -report
           Dump full command line and log output to a file named "program-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log" in the current directory.  This file
           can be useful for bug reports.  It also implies "-loglevel debug".

           Setting the environment variable FFREPORT to any value has the same effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value
           sequence, these options will affect the report; option values must be escaped if they contain special characters or the
           options delimiter ':' (see the ``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

           The following options are recognized:

           file
               set the file name to use for the report; %p is expanded to the name of the program, %t is expanded to a timestamp,
               "%%" is expanded to a plain "%"

           level
               set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see "-loglevel").

           For example, to output a report to a file named ffreport.log using a log level of 32 (alias for log level "info"):

                   FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output

           Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will not appear in the report.

       -hide_banner
           Suppress printing banner.

           All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build options and library versions. This option can be used to
           suppress printing this information.

       -cpuflags flags (global)
           Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're
           doing.

                   ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
                   ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
                   ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

           Possible flags for this option are:

           x86
               mmx
               mmxext
               sse

       -cpucount count (global)
           Override detection of CPU count. This option is intended for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.

                   ffmpeg -cpucount 2

       -max_alloc bytes
           Set the maximum size limit for allocating a block on the heap by ffmpeg's family of malloc functions. Exercise extreme
           caution when using this option. Don't use if you do not understand the full consequence of doing so.  Default is
           INT_MAX.

   AVOptions
       These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available
       AVOptions, use the -help option. They are separated into two categories:

       generic
           These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options are listed under AVFormatContext options
           for containers/devices and under AVCodecContext options for codecs.

       private
           These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private options are listed under their corresponding
           containers/devices/codecs.

       For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to an MP3 file, use the id3v2_version private option of
       the MP3 muxer:

               ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3

       All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier should be attached to them:

               ffmpeg -i multichannel.mxf -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -map 0:a:0 -c:a:0 ac3 -b:a:0 640k -ac:a:1 2 -c:a:1 aac -b:2 128k out.mp4

       In the above example, a multichannel audio stream is mapped twice for output.  The first instance is encoded with codec ac3
       and bitrate 640k.  The second instance is downmixed to 2 channels and encoded with codec aac. A bitrate of 128k is specified
       for it using absolute index of the output stream.

       Note: the -nooption syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions, use -option 0/-option 1.

       Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete
       and will be removed soon.

   Main options
       -x width
           Force displayed width.

       -y height
           Force displayed height.

       -fs Start in fullscreen mode.

       -an Disable audio.

       -vn Disable video.

       -sn Disable subtitles.

       -ss pos
           Seek to pos. Note that in most formats it is not possible to seek exactly, so ffplay will seek to the nearest seek point
           to pos.

           pos must be a time duration specification, see the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

       -t duration
           Play duration seconds of audio/video.

           duration must be a time duration specification, see the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

       -bytes
           Seek by bytes.

       -seek_interval
           Set custom interval, in seconds, for seeking using left/right keys. Default is 10 seconds.

       -nodisp
           Disable graphical display.

       -noborder
           Borderless window.

       -alwaysontop
           Window always on top. Available on: X11 with SDL &gt;= 2.0.5, Windows SDL &gt;= 2.0.6.

       -volume
           Set the startup volume. 0 means silence, 100 means no volume reduction or amplification. Negative values are treated as
           0, values above 100 are treated as 100.

       -f fmt
           Force format.

       -window_title title
           Set window title (default is the input filename).

       -left title
           Set the x position for the left of the window (default is a centered window).

       -top title
           Set the y position for the top of the window (default is a centered window).

       -loop number
           Loops movie playback &lt;number&gt; times. 0 means forever.

       -showmode mode
           Set the show mode to use.  Available values for mode are:

           0, video
               show video

           1, waves
               show audio waves

           2, rdft
               show audio frequency band using RDFT ((Inverse) Real Discrete Fourier Transform)

           Default value is "video", if video is not present or cannot be played "rdft" is automatically selected.

           You can interactively cycle through the available show modes by pressing the key w.

       -vf filtergraph
           Create the filtergraph specified by filtergraph and use it to filter the video stream.

           filtergraph is a description of the filtergraph to apply to the stream, and must have a single video input and a single
           video output. In the filtergraph, the input is associated to the label "in", and the output to the label "out". See the
           ffmpeg-filters manual for more information about the filtergraph syntax.

           You can specify this parameter multiple times and cycle through the specified filtergraphs along with the show modes by
           pressing the key w.

       -af filtergraph
           filtergraph is a description of the filtergraph to apply to the input audio.  Use the option "-filters" to show all the
           available filters (including sources and sinks).

       -i input_url
           Read input_url.

   Advanced options
       -stats
           Print several playback statistics, in particular show the stream duration, the codec parameters, the current position in
           the stream and the audio/video synchronisation drift. It is shown by default, unless the log level is lower than "info".
           Its display can be forced by manually specifying this option. To disable it, you need to specify "-nostats".

       -fast
           Non-spec-compliant optimizations.

       -genpts
           Generate pts.

       -sync type
           Set the master clock to audio ("type=audio"), video ("type=video") or external ("type=ext"). Default is audio. The
           master clock is used to control audio-video synchronization. Most media players use audio as master clock, but in some
           cases (streaming or high quality broadcast) it is necessary to change that. This option is mainly used for debugging
           purposes.

       -ast audio_stream_specifier
           Select the desired audio stream using the given stream specifier. The stream specifiers are described in the Stream
           specifiers chapter. If this option is not specified, the "best" audio stream is selected in the program of the already
           selected video stream.

       -vst video_stream_specifier
           Select the desired video stream using the given stream specifier. The stream specifiers are described in the Stream
           specifiers chapter. If this option is not specified, the "best" video stream is selected.

       -sst subtitle_stream_specifier
           Select the desired subtitle stream using the given stream specifier. The stream specifiers are described in the Stream
           specifiers chapter. If this option is not specified, the "best" subtitle stream is selected in the program of the
           already selected video or audio stream.

       -autoexit
           Exit when video is done playing.

       -exitonkeydown
           Exit if any key is pressed.

       -exitonmousedown
           Exit if any mouse button is pressed.

       -codec:media_specifier codec_name
           Force a specific decoder implementation for the stream identified by media_specifier, which can assume the values "a"
           (audio), "v" (video), and "s" subtitle.

       -acodec codec_name
           Force a specific audio decoder.

       -vcodec codec_name
           Force a specific video decoder.

       -scodec codec_name
           Force a specific subtitle decoder.

       -autorotate
           Automatically rotate the video according to file metadata. Enabled by default, use -noautorotate to disable it.

       -framedrop
           Drop video frames if video is out of sync. Enabled by default if the master clock is not set to video. Use this option
           to enable frame dropping for all master clock sources, use -noframedrop to disable it.

       -infbuf
           Do not limit the input buffer size, read as much data as possible from the input as soon as possible. Enabled by default
           for realtime streams, where data may be dropped if not read in time. Use this option to enable infinite buffers for all
           inputs, use -noinfbuf to disable it.

       -filter_threads nb_threads
           Defines how many threads are used to process a filter pipeline. Each pipeline will produce a thread pool with this many
           threads available for parallel processing. The default is 0 which means that the thread count will be determined by the
           number of available CPUs.

   While playing
       q, ESC
           Quit.

       f   Toggle full screen.

       p, SPC
           Pause.

       m   Toggle mute.

       9, 0
       /, *
           Decrease and increase volume respectively.

       a   Cycle audio channel in the current program.

       v   Cycle video channel.

       t   Cycle subtitle channel in the current program.

       c   Cycle program.

       w   Cycle video filters or show modes.

       s   Step to the next frame.

           Pause if the stream is not already paused, step to the next video frame, and pause.

       left/right
           Seek backward/forward 10 seconds.
