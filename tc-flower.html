DESCRIPTION
       The flower filter matches flows to the set of keys specified and assigns an arbitrarily chosen class ID to packets belonging
       to them. Additionally (or alternatively) an action from the generic action framework may be called.

OPTIONS
       action ACTION_SPEC
              Apply an action from the generic actions framework on matching packets.

       classid CLASSID
              Specify a class to pass matching packets on to.  CLASSID is in the form X:Y, while X and Y are interpreted as numbers
              in hexadecimal format.

       hw_tc TCID
              Specify a hardware traffic class to pass matching packets on to. TCID is in the range 0 through 15.

       indev ifname
              Match  on incoming interface name. Obviously this makes sense only for forwarded flows.  ifname is the name of an in‐
              terface which must exist at the time of tc invocation.

       verbose
              Enable verbose logging, including offloading errors when not using skip_sw flag.

       skip_sw
              Do not process filter by software. If hardware has no offload support for this filter, or TC offload is  not  enabled
              for the interface, operation will fail.

       skip_hw
              Do not process filter by hardware.

       dst_mac MASKED_LLADDR
       src_mac MASKED_LLADDR
              Match on source or destination MAC address.  A mask may be optionally provided to limit the bits of the address which
              are matched. A mask is provided by following the address with a slash and then the mask. It may be provided in LLADDR
              format, in which case it is a bitwise mask, or as a number of high bits to match. If the mask is missing then a match
              on all bits is assumed.

       num_of_vlans NUM
              Match on the number of vlan tags in the packet.  NUM can be 0 or small positive integer. Typically in 0-4 range.

       vlan_id VID
              Match on vlan tag id.  VID is an unsigned 12bit value in decimal format.

       vlan_prio PRIORITY
              Match on vlan tag priority.  PRIORITY is an unsigned 3bit value in decimal format.

       vlan_ethtype VLAN_ETH_TYPE
              Match on layer three protocol.  VLAN_ETH_TYPE may be either ipv4, ipv6 or an unsigned 16bit value in hexadecimal for‐
              mat. To match on QinQ packet, it must be 802.1Q or 802.1AD.

       cvlan_id VID
              Match on QinQ inner vlan tag id.  VID is an unsigned 12bit value in decimal format.

       cvlan_prio PRIORITY
              Match on QinQ inner vlan tag priority.  PRIORITY is an unsigned 3bit value in decimal format.

       cvlan_ethtype VLAN_ETH_TYPE
              Match on QinQ layer three protocol.  VLAN_ETH_TYPE may be either ipv4, ipv6 or an unsigned 16bit value in hexadecimal
              format.

       pppoe_sid PSID
              Match on PPPoE session id.  PSID is an unsigned 16bit value in decimal format.

       ppp_proto PPP_PROTO
              Match on PPP layer three protocol.  PPP_PROTO may be either ip, ipv6, mpls_uc, mpls_mc or an unsigned 16bit value  in
              hexadecimal format.

       mpls LSE_LIST
              Match  on the MPLS label stack.  LSE_LIST is a list of Label Stack Entries, each introduced by the lse keyword.  This
              option can't be used together with the standalone mpls_label, mpls_tc, mpls_bos and mpls_ttl options.

              lse LSE_OPTIONS
                     Match on an MPLS Label Stack Entry.  LSE_OPTIONS is a list of options that describe the properties of the  LSE
                     to match.

                     depth DEPTH
                            The  depth  of  the Label Stack Entry to consider. Depth starts at 1 (the outermost Label Stack Entry).
                            The maximum usable depth may be limited by the kernel. This option is mandatory.  DEPTH is an  unsigned
                            8 bit value in decimal format.

                     label LABEL
                            Match  on  the  MPLS  Label field at the specified depth.  LABEL is an unsigned 20 bit value in decimal

                            format.

                     bos BOS
                            Match  on  the MPLS Bottom Of Stack field at the specified depth.  BOS is a 1 bit value in decimal for‐

                     ttl TTL
                            Match on the MPLS Time To Live field at the specified depth.  TTL is an unsigned 8 bit value in decimal
                            format.

       mpls_label LABEL
              Match the label id in the outermost MPLS label stack entry.  LABEL is an unsigned 20 bit value in decimal format.

       mpls_tc TC
              Match on the MPLS TC field, which is typically used for packet priority, in the outermost MPLS label stack entry.  TC
              is an unsigned 3 bit value in decimal format.

       mpls_bos BOS
              Match on the MPLS Bottom Of Stack field in the outermost MPLS label stack entry.  BOS is a 1  bit  value  in  decimal
              format.

              imal format.

       ip_proto IP_PROTO
              Match on layer four protocol.  IP_PROTO may be tcp, udp, sctp, icmp, icmpv6 or an unsigned 8bit value in  hexadecimal
              format.

       ip_tos MASKED_IP_TOS
              Match  on  ipv4  TOS  or ipv6 traffic-class - eight bits in hexadecimal format.  A mask may be optionally provided to
              limit the bits which are matched. A mask is provided by following the value with a slash and then the  mask.  If  the
              mask is missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

       ip_ttl MASKED_IP_TTL
              Match  on  ipv4 TTL or ipv6 hop-limit  - eight bits value in decimal or hexadecimal format.  A mask may be optionally
              provided to limit the bits which are matched. Same logic is used for the mask as with matching on ip_tos.

       dst_ip PREFIX
       src_ip PREFIX
              Match on source or destination IP address.  PREFIX must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending  on  the  protocol
              option  to  tc  filter, optionally followed by a slash and the prefix length.  If the prefix is missing, tc assumes a
              full-length host match.

       dst_port { MASKED_NUMBER |  MIN_VALUE-MAX_VALUE }
       src_port { MASKED_NUMBER |  MIN_VALUE-MAX_VALUE }
              Match on layer 4 protocol source or destination port number, with an optional mask. Alternatively,  the  minimum  and
              maximum  values  can  be  specified  to match on a range of layer 4 protocol source or destination port numbers. Only
              available for ip_proto values udp, tcp and sctp which have to be specified in beforehand.

       tcp_flags MASKED_TCP_FLAGS
              Match on TCP flags represented as 12bit bitfield in in hexadecimal format.  A mask  may  be  optionally  provided  to
              limit  the  bits  which are matched. A mask is provided by following the value with a slash and then the mask. If the
              mask is missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

       type MASKED_TYPE
       code MASKED_CODE
              Match on ICMP type or code. A mask may be optionally provided to limit the bits of the address which are  matched.  A
              mask  is  provided by following the address with a slash and then the mask. The mask must be as a number which repre‐
              sents a bitwise mask If the mask is missing then a match on all bits is assumed.  Only available for ip_proto  values
              icmp and icmpv6 which have to be specified in beforehand.

       arp_tip IPV4_PREFIX
       arp_sip IPV4_PREFIX
              Match  on ARP or RARP sender or target IP address.  IPV4_PREFIX must be a valid IPv4 address optionally followed by a
              slash and the prefix length. If the prefix is missing, tc assumes a full-length host match.

       arp_op ARP_OP
              Match on ARP or RARP operation.  ARP_OP may be request, reply or an integer value 0, 1 or 2.  A mask may  be  option‐
              ally  provided to limit the bits of the operation which are matched. A mask is provided by following the address with
              a slash and then the mask. It may be provided as an unsigned 8 bit value representing a bitwise mask. If the mask  is
              missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

       arp_sha MASKED_LLADDR
       arp_tha MASKED_LLADDR
              Match  on  ARP  or RARP sender or target MAC address.  A mask may be optionally provided to limit the bits of the ad‐
              dress which are matched. A mask is provided by following the address with a slash and then the mask. It may  be  pro‐
              vided  in  LLADDR  format,  in  which case it is a bitwise mask, or as a number of high bits to match. If the mask is
              missing then a match on all bits is assumed.

                     est - Established connection.

                     rpl - The packet is in the reply direction, meaning that it is in the opposite direction from the packet  that
                     initiated the connection.

                     inv - The state is invalid. The packet couldn't be associated to a connection.

                     rel - The packet is related to an existing connection.

       vxlan_opts OPTIONS
       erspan_opts OPTIONS
       gtp_opts OPTIONS
              Match  on  IP tunnel metadata. Key id NUMBER is a 32 bit tunnel key id (e.g. VNI for VXLAN tunnel).  PREFIX must be a
              valid IPv4 or IPv6 address optionally followed by a slash and the prefix length. If the prefix is missing, tc assumes
              a full-length host match.  Dst port NUMBER is a 16 bit UDP dst port. Tos NUMBER is an 8 bit tos (dscp+ecn) value, ttl
              NUMBER is an 8 bit time-to-live value. geneve_opts OPTIONS must be a valid list  of  comma-separated  geneve  options
              where  each  option consists of a key optionally followed by a slash and corresponding mask. If the masks is missing,
              tc    assumes    a    full-length     match.     The     options     can     be     described     in     the     form
              CLASS:TYPE:DATA/CLASS_MASK:TYPE_MASK:DATA_MASK,  where  CLASS is represented as a 16bit hexadecimal value, TYPE as an
              8bit hexadecimal value and DATA as a variable length hexadecimal value.  vxlan_opts OPTIONS doesn't support  multiple
              options,  and  it  consists of a key followed by a slash and corresponding mask. If the mask is missing, tc assumes a
              full-length match. The option can be described in the form GBP/GBP_MASK, where GBP is represented as a 32bit  number.
              erspan_opts  OPTIONS doesn't support multiple options, and it consists of a key followed by a slash and corresponding
              mask. If the mask is missing, tc assumes a full-length match. The option can be described  in  the  form  VERSION:IN‐
              DEX:DIR:HWID/VERSION:INDEX_MASK:DIR_MASK:HWID_MASK,  where VERSION is represented as a 8bit number, INDEX as an 32bit
              number, DIR and HWID as a 8bit number. Multiple options is not supported. Note INDEX/INDEX_MASK is used when  VERSION
              is  1, and DIR/DIR_MASK and HWID/HWID_MASK are used when VERSION is 2.  gtp_opts OPTIONS doesn't support multiple op‐
              tions, and it consists of a key followed by a slash and corresponding mask. If the mask  is  missing,  tc  assumes  a
              full-length  match.  The  option can be described in the form PDU_TYPE:QFI/PDU_TYPE_MASK:QFI_MASK where both PDU_TYPE
              and QFI are represented as a 8bit hexadecimal values.

       ip_flags IP_FLAGS
              IP_FLAGS may be either frag, nofrag, firstfrag or nofirstfrag where frag and nofrag could be used to match  on  frag‐
              mented  packets or not, respectively. firstfrag and nofirstfrag can be used to further distinguish fragmented packet.
              firstfrag can be used to indicate the first fragmented packet. nofirstfrag can be used to indicates subsequent  frag‐
              mented packets or non-fragmented packets.

NOTES
       As  stated above where applicable, matches of a certain layer implicitly depend on the matches of the next lower layer. Pre‐
       cisely, layer one and two matches (indev,  dst_mac and src_mac) have no dependency, MPLS  and  layer  three  matches  (mpls,
       mpls_label,  mpls_tc, mpls_bos, mpls_ttl, ip_proto, dst_ip, src_ip, arp_tip, arp_sip, arp_op, arp_tha, arp_sha and ip_flags)
       depend on the protocol option of tc filter, layer four port matches (dst_port and src_port) depend on ip_proto being set  to
       tcp, udp or sctp, and finally ICMP matches (code and type) depend on ip_proto being set to icmp or icmpv6.

       There can be only used one mask per one prio. If user needs to specify different mask, he has to use different prio.
