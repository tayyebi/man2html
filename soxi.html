NAME
       SoXI - Sound eXchange Information, display sound file metadata

SYNOPSIS
       soxi [-V[level]] [-T] [-t|-r|-c|-s|-d|-D|-b|-B|-p|-e|-a] infile1 ...

DESCRIPTION
       Displays information from the header of a given audio file or files.  Supported audio file types are listed and described in
       soxformat(7).  Note however, that soxi is intended for use only with audio files with a self-describing header.

       By default, as much information as is available is shown.  An option may be given to select just a single piece of  informa‐
       tion (perhaps for use in a script or batch-file).

OPTIONS
       -V     Set verbosity. See sox(1) for details.

       -T     Used  with  multiple files; changes the behaviour of -s, -d and -D to display the total across all given files.  Note
              that when used with -s with files with different sampling rates, this is of questionable value.

       -t     Show detected file-type.

       -r     Show sample-rate.

       -c     Show number of channels.

       -s     Show number of samples (0 if unavailable).

       -d     Show duration in hours, minutes and seconds (0 if unavailable).  Equivalent to number of samples divided by the  sam‐
              ple-rate.

       -D     Show duration in seconds (0 if unavailable).

       -b     Show number of bits per sample (0 if not applicable).

       -B     Show the bitrate averaged over the whole file (0 if unavailable).

       -p     Show estimated sample precision in bits.

       -e     Show the name of the audio encoding.

       -a     Show file comments (annotations) if available.
