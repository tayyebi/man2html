NAME
       charmap - character set description file

DESCRIPTION
       A character set description (charmap) defines all available characters and their encodings in a character set.  localedef(1)
       can use charmaps to create locale variants for different character sets.

   Syntax
       The charmap file starts with a header that may consist of the following keywords:

       &lt;code_set_name&gt;
              is followed by the name of the character map.

       &lt;comment_char&gt;
              is followed by a character that will be used as the comment character for the rest of the file.  It defaults  to  the
              number sign (#).

       &lt;escape_char&gt;
              is  followed  by  a character that should be used as the escape character for the rest of the file to mark characters
              that should be interpreted in a special way.  It defaults to the backslash (\).

       &lt;mb_cur_max&gt;
              is followed by the maximum number of bytes for a character.  The default value is 1.

       &lt;mb_cur_min&gt;
              is followed by the minimum number of bytes for a character.  This value must be less than or equal than &lt;mb_cur_max&gt;.
              If not specified, it defaults to &lt;mb_cur_max&gt;.

       The character set definition section starts with the keyword CHARMAP in the first column.

       The following lines may have one of the two following forms to define the character set:

       &lt;character&gt; byte-sequence comment
              This form defines exactly one character and its byte sequence, comment being optional.

       &lt;character&gt;..&lt;character&gt; byte-sequence comment
              This form defines a character range and its byte sequence, comment being optional.

       The character set definition section ends with the string END CHARMAP.

       The character set definition section may optionally be followed by a section to define widths of characters.

       The  WIDTH_DEFAULT  keyword  can  be used to define the default width for all characters not explicitly listed.  The default
       character width is 1.

       The width section for individual characters starts with the keyword WIDTH in the first column.

       The following lines may have one of the two following forms to define the widths of the characters:

       &lt;character&gt; width
              This form defines the width of exactly one character.

       &lt;character&gt;...&lt;character&gt; width
              This form defines the width for all the characters in the range.

       The width definition section ends with the string END WIDTH.

FILES
       /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
              Usual default character map path.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.2.

EXAMPLES
       The Euro sign is defined as follows in the UTF-8 charmap:

       &lt;U20AC&gt;     /xe2/x82/xac EURO SIGN
