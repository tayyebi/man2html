<pre>init_module(2)                                          System Calls Manual                                          init_module(2)

NAME
       init_module, finit_module - load a kernel module

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;    /* Definition of MODULE_* constants */
       #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;     /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int syscall(SYS_init_module, void module_image[.len], unsigned long len,
                   const char *param_values);
       int syscall(SYS_finit_module, int fd,
                   const char *param_values, int flags);

       Note: glibc provides no wrappers for these system calls, necessitating the use of syscall(2).

DESCRIPTION
       init_module() loads an ELF image into kernel space, performs any necessary symbol relocations, initializes module parameters
       to values provided by the caller, and then runs the module's init function.  This system call requires privilege.

       The module_image argument points to a buffer containing the binary image to be loaded; len specifies the size of  that  buf‐
       fer.  The module image should be a valid ELF image, built for the running kernel.

       The param_values argument is a string containing space-delimited specifications of the values for module parameters (defined
       inside the module using module_param() and module_param_array()).  The kernel parses this string and initializes the  speci‐
       fied parameters.  Each of the parameter specifications has the form:

               name[=value[,value...]]

       The  parameter  name  is  one  of those defined within the module using module_param() (see the Linux kernel source file in‐
       clude/linux/moduleparam.h).  The parameter value is optional in the case of bool and invbool parameters.  Values  for  array
       parameters are specified as a comma-separated list.

   finit_module()
       The  finit_module() system call is like init_module(), but reads the module to be loaded from the file descriptor fd.  It is
       useful when the authenticity of a kernel module can be determined from its location in the filesystem; in cases  where  that
       is  possible,  the  overhead  of  using  cryptographically  signed  modules to determine the authenticity of a module can be
       avoided.  The param_values argument is as for init_module().

       The flags argument modifies the operation of finit_module().  It is a bit mask value created by ORing together zero or  more
       of the following flags:

       MODULE_INIT_IGNORE_MODVERSIONS
              Ignore symbol version hashes.

       MODULE_INIT_IGNORE_VERMAGIC
              Ignore kernel version magic.

       There  are  some  safety  checks built into a module to ensure that it matches the kernel against which it is loaded.  These
       checks are recorded when the module is built and verified when the module is loaded.  First, the module records a "vermagic"
       string  containing the kernel version number and prominent features (such as the CPU type).  Second, if the module was built
       with the CONFIG_MODVERSIONS configuration option enabled, a version hash is recorded for each symbol the module uses.   This
       hash is based on the types of the arguments and return value for the function named by the symbol.  In this case, the kernel
       version number within the "vermagic" string is ignored, as the symbol version hashes are assumed to  be  sufficiently  reli‐
       able.

       Using  the  MODULE_INIT_IGNORE_VERMAGIC  flag indicates that the "vermagic" string is to be ignored, and the MODULE_INIT_IG‐
       NORE_MODVERSIONS flag indicates that the symbol version hashes are to be ignored.  If the kernel is built to  permit  forced
       loading  (i.e., configured with CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_LOAD), then loading continues, otherwise it fails with the error ENOEXEC
       as expected for malformed modules.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these system calls return 0.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADMSG (since Linux 3.7)
              Module signature is misformatted.

       EBUSY  Timeout while trying to resolve a symbol reference by this module.

       EFAULT An address argument referred to a location that is outside the process's accessible address space.

       ENOKEY (since Linux 3.7)
              Module signature is invalid or the kernel does not have a key for this module.  This error is returned  only  if  the
              kernel  was  configured  with CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE; if the kernel was not configured with this option, then an in‐
              valid or unsigned module simply taints the kernel.

       ENOMEM Out of memory.

       EPERM  The caller was not privileged (did not have the CAP_SYS_MODULE  capability),  or  module  loading  is  disabled  (see
              /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled in proc(5)).

       The following errors may additionally occur for init_module():

       EEXIST A module with this name is already loaded.

       EINVAL param_values is invalid, or some part of the ELF image in module_image contains inconsistencies.

       ENOEXEC
              The  binary image supplied in module_image is not an ELF image, or is an ELF image that is invalid or for a different
              architecture.

       The following errors may additionally occur for finit_module():

       EBADF  The file referred to by fd is not opened for reading.

       EFBIG  The file referred to by fd is too large.

       EINVAL flags is invalid.

       ENOEXEC
              fd does not refer to an open file.

       ETXTBSY (since Linux 4.7)
              The file referred to by fd is opened for read-write.

       In addition to the above errors, if the module's init function is executed and  returns  an  error,  then  init_module()  or
       finit_module() fails and errno is set to the value returned by the init function.

VERSIONS
       finit_module() is available since Linux 3.8.

STANDARDS
       init_module() and finit_module() are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       The  init_module() system call is not supported by glibc.  No declaration is provided in glibc headers, but, through a quirk
       of history, glibc versions before glibc 2.23 did export an ABI for this system call.  Therefore, in  order  to  employ  this
       system call, it is (before glibc 2.23) sufficient to manually declare the interface in your code; alternatively, you can in‐
       voke the system call using syscall(2).

       Information about currently loaded modules can be found in /proc/modules and in the file trees under the  per-module  subdi‐
       rectories under /sys/module.

       See the Linux kernel source file include/linux/module.h for some useful background information.

   Linux 2.4 and earlier
       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, the init_module() system call was rather different:

           #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;

           int init_module(const char *name, struct module *image);

       (User-space  applications  can detect which version of init_module() is available by calling query_module(); the latter call
       fails with the error ENOSYS on Linux 2.6 and later.)

       The older version of the system call loads the relocated module image pointed to by image into kernel  space  and  runs  the
       module's  init  function.   The  caller is responsible for providing the relocated image (since Linux 2.6, the init_module()
       system call does the relocation).

       The module image begins with a module structure and is followed by code and data as appropriate.  Since Linux 2.2, the  mod‐
       ule structure is defined as follows:

           struct module {
               unsigned long         size_of_struct;
               struct module        *next;
               const char           *name;
               unsigned long         size;
               long                  usecount;
               unsigned long         flags;
               unsigned int          nsyms;
               unsigned int          ndeps;
               struct module_symbol *syms;
               struct module_ref    *deps;
               struct module_ref    *refs;
               int                 (*init)(void);
               void                (*cleanup)(void);
               const struct exception_table_entry *ex_table_start;
               const struct exception_table_entry *ex_table_end;
           #ifdef __alpha__
               unsigned long gp;
           #endif
           };

       All of the pointer fields, with the exception of next and refs, are expected to point within the module body and be initial‐
       ized as appropriate for kernel space, that is, relocated with the rest of the module.
