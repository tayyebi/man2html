<pre>getgroups(2)                                            System Calls Manual                                            getgroups(2)

NAME
       getgroups, setgroups - get/set list of supplementary group IDs

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int getgroups(int size, gid_t list[]);

       #include &lt;grp.h&gt;

       int setgroups(size_t size, const gid_t *_Nullable list);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       setgroups():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       getgroups() returns the supplementary group IDs of the calling process in list.  The argument size should be set to the max‐
       imum number of items that can be stored in the buffer pointed to by list.  If the calling process is a member of  more  than
       size supplementary groups, then an error results.

       It  is unspecified whether the effective group ID of the calling process is included in the returned list.  (Thus, an appli‐
       cation should also call getegid(2) and add or remove the resulting value.)

       If size is zero, list is not modified, but the total number of supplementary group IDs for the process  is  returned.   This
       allows the caller to determine the size of a dynamically allocated list to be used in a further call to getgroups().

       setgroups() sets the supplementary group IDs for the calling process.  Appropriate privileges are required (see the descrip‐
       tion of the EPERM error, below).  The size argument specifies the number of supplementary group IDs in the buffer pointed to
       by list.  A process can drop all of its supplementary groups with the call:

           setgroups(0, NULL);

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, getgroups() returns the number of supplementary group IDs.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indi‐
       cate the error.

       On success, setgroups() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT list has an invalid address.

       getgroups() can additionally fail with the following error:

       EINVAL size is less than the number of supplementary group IDs, but is not zero.

       setgroups() can additionally fail with the following errors:

       EINVAL size is greater than NGROUPS_MAX (32 before Linux 2.6.4; 65536 since Linux 2.6.4).

       ENOMEM Out of memory.

       EPERM  The calling process has insufficient privilege (the caller does not have the CAP_SETGID capability in the user  name‐
              space in which it resides).

       EPERM (since Linux 3.19)
              The  use  of  setgroups() is denied in this user namespace.  See the description of /proc/pid/setgroups in user_name‐
              spaces(7).

STANDARDS
       getgroups(): SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

       setgroups(): SVr4, 4.3BSD.  Since setgroups() requires privilege, it is not covered by POSIX.1.

NOTES
       A process can have up to NGROUPS_MAX supplementary  group  IDs  in  addition  to  the  effective  group  ID.   The  constant
       NGROUPS_MAX  is  defined  in  &lt;limits.h&gt;.  The set of supplementary group IDs is inherited from the parent process, and pre‐
       served across an execve(2).

       The maximum number of supplementary group IDs can be found at run time using sysconf(3):

           long ngroups_max;
           ngroups_max = sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX);

       The maximum return value of getgroups() cannot be larger than one more than this value.  Since Linux 2.6.4, the maximum num‐
       ber of supplementary group IDs is also exposed via the Linux-specific read-only file, /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max.

       The  original  Linux  getgroups() system call supported only 16-bit group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added getgroups32(),
       supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc getgroups() wrapper function transparently deals with the  variation  across  kernel  ver‐
       sions.

   C library/kernel differences
       At  the  kernel  level,  user  IDs  and group IDs are a per-thread attribute.  However, POSIX requires that all threads in a
       process share the same credentials.  The NPTL threading implementation handles the POSIX requirements by  providing  wrapper
       functions  for  the  various system calls that change process UIDs and GIDs.  These wrapper functions (including the one for
       setgroups()) employ a signal-based technique to ensure that when one thread changes credentials, all of the other threads in
       the process also change their credentials.  For details, see nptl(7).
