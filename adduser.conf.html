NAME
       /etc/adduser.conf - configuration file for adduser(8) and addgroup(8).

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  /etc/adduser.conf  contains  defaults for the programs adduser(8), addgroup(8), deluser(8) and delgroup(8).  Each
       line holds a single value pair in the form option = value.  Double or single quotes are allowed  around  the  value,  as  is
       whitespace around the equals sign.  Comment lines must have a hash sign (#) in the first column.

       The valid configuration options are:

       DSHELL The login shell to be used for all new users.  Defaults to /bin/bash.

       DHOME  The directory in which new home directories should be created.  Defaults to /home.

       GROUPHOMES
              If this is set to yes, the home directories will be created as /home/groupname/user.  Defaults to no.

       LETTERHOMES
              If  this  is  set  to yes, then the home directories created will have an extra directory inserted which is the first
              letter of the loginname.  For example: /home/u/user.  Defaults to no.

       SKEL   The directory from which skeletal user configuration files should be copied.  Defaults to /etc/skel.

       FIRST_SYSTEM_UID and LAST_SYSTEM_UID
              specify an inclusive range of UIDs from which system UIDs can be  dynamically  allocated.   Default  to  100  -  999.
              Please  note  that system software, such as the users allocated by the base-passwd package, may assume that UIDs less
              than 100 are unallocated.

       FIRST_UID and LAST_UID
              specify an inclusive range of UIDs from which normal user's UIDs can be dynamically allocated.   Default  to  1000  -
              59999.

       FIRST_SYSTEM_GID and LAST_SYSTEM_GID
              specify an inclusive range of GIDs from which system GIDs can be dynamically allocated.  Default to 100 - 999.

       FIRST_GID and LAST_GID
              specify  an  inclusive  range of GIDs from which normal group's GIDs can be dynamically allocated.  Default to 1000 -
              59999.

       USERGROUPS
              If this is set to yes, then each created non-system user will be given their own group to use.  The default is yes.

       USERS_GID
              USERS_GROUP Defines the group name or GID of the group all newly-created non-system users are placed into.  If  USER‐
              GROUPS  is yes, the group will be added as a supplementary group; if USERGROUPS is no,, it will be the primary group.
              If you don't want all your users to be in one group, set USERGROUPS is yes, leave USERS_GROUP empty and set USERS_GID
              to "-1".  The default value of USERS_GROUP is users, which has GID 100 on all Debian systems since it's defined stat‐
              ically by the base-passwd package.

       DIR_MODE
              If set to a valid value (e.g. 0755 or 755), directories created will have the specified permissions  mode.  Otherwise
              2700 is used as default.  (See SYS_DIR_MODE for system users.)  Note that there are potential configurations (such as
              /~user web services, or in-home mail delivery) which will require changes to the default.

       SYS_DIR_MODE
              If set to a valid value (e.g. 0755 or 755), directories created for system users will have the specified  permissions
              mode.  Otherwise 0755 is used as default.  Note that changing the default permissions for system users may cause some
              packages to behave unreliably, if the program relies on the default setting.

       SETGID_HOME
              If this is set to yes, then home directories for users with their own group (USERGROUPS = yes) will have  the  setgid
              bit  set.  This is the default setting for normal user accounts.  If you set this to "no", you should also change the
              value of DIR_MODE, as the default (2700) sets this bit regardless.  Note that this feature is deprecated and will  be
              removed in a future version of adduser.  Please use DIR_MODE instead.

       QUOTAUSER
              If set to a nonempty value, new users will have quotas copied from that user.  The default is empty.

       NAME_REGEX
              User  and  group  names  are checked against this regular expression. If the name doesn't match this regexp, user and
              group creation in adduser is refused unless --allow-badname is set. With --allow-badname set, only  weak  checks  are
              performed. The default is the most conservative ^[a-z][-a-z0-9_]*$. See Valid names, below, for more information.

       SYS_NAME_REGEX
              System  user  and group names are checked against this regular expression. If this variable is not set, it falls back
              to the default value.  If the name doesn't match this regexp, system user and group creation in  adduser  is  refused
              unless --allow-badname is set. With --allow-badname set, only weak checks are performed. The default is the most con‐
              servative ^[a-z_][-a-z0-9_]*$.  See Valid names, below, for more information.

       SKEL_IGNORE_REGEX
              Files in /etc/skel/ are checked against this regex, and not copied to the newly created home directory if they match.
              This   is  by  default  set  to  the  regular  expression  matching  files  left  over  from  unmerged  config  files
              (dpkg-(old|new|dist)).

       ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS
              Setting this to something other than 0 (the default) will cause adduser to add newly created non-system users to  the
              list of groups defined by  EXTRA_GROUPS (below).

       EXTRA_GROUPS
              This is the space-separated list of groups that new non-system users will be added to.

NOTES
       VALID NAMES

       Historically, adduser and addgroup enforced conformity
              to  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, which allows only the following characters to appear in group and user names: letters, dig‐
              its, underscores, periods, at signs (@) and dashes.  The name may not start with a dash or @.  The "$"  sign  is  al‐
              lowed at the end of usernames (to conform to samba).

       The default settings for NAME_REGEXP and SYS_NAME_REGEX
              allow  usernames to contain lowercase letters and numbers, plus dash (-) and underscore (_); the name must begin with
              a letter (or an underscore for system users).

       The least restrictive policy, available by using the --allow-all-names
              option, simply makes the same checks as useradd: cannot start with a dash, plus sign, or tilde; and cannot contain  a
              colon, comma, slash, or whitespace.

       This option can be used to create confusing or misleading names; use
              it with caution.

       Please note that regardless of the regular expressions used to evaluate
              the  username,  it may be a maximum of 32 bytes; this may be less than 32 visual characters when using Unicode glyphs
              in the username.
