NAME
       Dpkg::Compression::Process - run compression/decompression processes

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an object oriented interface to run and manage compression/decompression processes.

METHODS
       $proc = Dpkg::Compression::Process-&gt;new(%opts)
           Create a new instance of the object. Supported options are "compression" and "compression_level" (see corresponding
           set_* functions).

       $proc-&gt;set_compression($comp)
           Select the compression method to use. It errors out if the method is not supported according to
           "compression_is_supported" (of Dpkg::Compression).

       $proc-&gt;set_compression_level($level)
           Select the compression level to use. It errors out if the level is not valid according to "compression_is_valid_level"
           (of Dpkg::Compression).

       @exec = $proc-&gt;get_compress_cmdline()
       @exec = $proc-&gt;get_uncompress_cmdline()
           Returns a list ready to be passed to "exec", its first element is the program name (either for compression or
           decompression) and the following elements are parameters for the program.

           When executed the program acts as a filter between its standard input and its standard output.

       $proc-&gt;compress(%opts)
           Starts a compressor program. You must indicate where it will read its uncompressed data from and where it will write its
           compressed data to.  This is accomplished by passing one parameter "to_*" and one parameter "from_*" as accepted by
           Dpkg::IPC::spawn.

           You must call "wait_end_process" after having called this method to properly close the sub-process (and verify that it
           exited without error).

       $proc-&gt;uncompress(%opts)
           Starts a decompressor program. You must indicate where it will read its compressed data from and where it will write its
           uncompressed data to.  This is accomplished by passing one parameter "to_*" and one parameter "from_*" as accepted by
           Dpkg::IPC::spawn.

           You must call "wait_end_process" after having called this method to properly close the sub-process (and verify that it
           exited without error).

       $proc-&gt;wait_end_process(%opts)
           Call Dpkg::IPC::wait_child to wait until the sub-process has exited and verify its return code. Any given option will be
           forwarded to the "wait_child" function. Most notably you can use the "nocheck" option to verify the return code yourself
           instead of letting "wait_child" do it for you.

CHANGES
   Version 1.00 (dpkg 1.15.6)
       Mark the module as public.

1.21.21                                                      2023-03-02                           Dpkg::Compression::Process(3perl)
