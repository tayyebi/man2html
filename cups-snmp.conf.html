NAME
       snmp.conf - snmp configuration file for cups (deprecated)

DESCRIPTION
       The  snmp.conf file configures how the standard CUPS network backends (http, https, ipp, ipps, lpd, snmp, and socket) access
       printer information using SNMPv1 and is normally located in the /etc/cups directory.  Each line in the file can be a config‐
       uration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.

       The  Community  and  DebugLevel  directives  are  used by all backends. The remainder apply only to the SNMP backend - cups-
       snmp(8).

DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood by the CUPS network backends:

       Address @IF(name)

       Address @LOCAL

       Address address
            Sends SNMP broadcast queries (for discovery) to the specified address(es).  There is no default for the  broadcast  ad‐
            dress.

       Community name
            Specifies  the  community  name  to use.  Only a single community name may be specified.  The default community name is
            "public".  If no name is specified, all SNMP functions are disabled.

       DebugLevel number
            Specifies the logging level from 0 (none) to 3 (everything).  Typically only used for debugging (thus the  name).   The
            default debug level is 0.

       DeviceURI "regular expression" device-uri [... device-uri]
            Specifies  one  or  more  device URIs that should be used for a given make and model string.  The regular expression is
            used to match the detected make and model, and the device URI strings must be of the form  "scheme://%s[:port]/[path]",
            where "%s" represents the detected address or hostname.  There are no default device URI matching rules.

       HostNameLookups on

       HostNameLookups off
            Specifies  whether the addresses of printers should be converted to hostnames or left as numeric IP addresses.  The de‐
            fault is "off".

       MaxRunTime seconds
            Specifies the maximum number of seconds that the SNMP backend will scan the network for printers.  The default  is  120
            seconds (2 minutes).

NOTES
       CUPS backends are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not sup‐
       port IPP can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
