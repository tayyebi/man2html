DESCRIPTION
     RPC library routines allow C language programs to make procedure calls on other machines across the network.  First a CLIENT
     handle is created and then the client calls a procedure to send a request to the server.  On receipt of the request, the
     server calls a dispatch routine to perform the requested service, and then sends a reply.

Routines
     clnt_control()
              A function macro to change or retrieve various information about a client object.  The req argument indicates the
              type of operation, and info is a pointer to the information.  For both connectionless and connection-oriented trans‐
              ports, the supported values of req and their argument types and what they do are:

              CLSET_TIMEOUT      struct timeval *    set total timeout
              CLGET_TIMEOUT      struct timeval *    get total timeout

              Note: if you set the timeout using clnt_control(), the timeout argument passed by clnt_call() is ignored in all sub‐
              sequent calls.

              Note: If you set the timeout value to 0, clnt_control() immediately returns an error (RPC_TIMEDOUT).  Set the timeout
              argument to 0 for batching calls.

              CLGET_SVC_ADDR     struct netbuf *     get servers address
              CLGET_FD           int *               get fd from handle
              CLSET_FD_CLOSE     void                close fd on destroy
              CLSET_FD_NCLOSE    void                don't close fd on destroy
              CLGET_VERS         u_int32_t *         get RPC program version
              CLSET_VERS         u_int32_t *         set RPC program version
              CLGET_XID          u_int32_t *         get XID of previous call
              CLSET_XID          u_int32_t *         set XID of next call

              The following operations are valid for connectionless transports only:

              CLSET_RETRY_TIMEOUT    struct timeval *    set the retry timeout
              CLGET_RETRY_TIMEOUT    struct timeval *    get the retry timeout
              CLSET_CONNECT          int *               use connect(2)

              The retry timeout is the time that RPC waits for the server to reply before retransmitting the request.  The
              clnt_control() function returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure.

     clnt_create()
              Generic client creation routine for program prognum and version versnum.  The host argument identifies the name of
              the remote host where the server is located.  The nettype argument indicates the class of transport protocol to use.
              The transports are tried in left to right order in NETPATH environment variable or in top to bottom order in the net‐
              config database.  The clnt_create() function tries all the transports of the nettype class available from the NETPATH
              environment variable and the netconfig database, and chooses the first successful one.  A default timeout is set and
              can be modified using clnt_control().  This routine returns NULL if it fails.  The clnt_pcreateerror() routine can be
              used to print the reason for failure.

              Note: clnt_create() returns a valid client handle even if the particular version number supplied to clnt_create() is
              not registered with the rpcbind(8) service.  This mismatch will be discovered by a clnt_call() later (see
              rpc_clnt_calls(3)).

     clnt_create_timed()
              Generic client creation routine which is similar to clnt_create() but which also has the additional argument timeout
              that specifies the maximum amount of time allowed for each transport class tried.  In all other respects, the
              clnt_create_timed() call behaves exactly like the clnt_create() call.

     clnt_create_vers()
              Generic client creation routine which is similar to clnt_create() but which also checks for the version availability.
              The host argument identifies the name of the remote host where the server is located.  The nettype argument indicates
              the class transport protocols to be used.  If the routine is successful it returns a client handle created for the
              highest version between vers_low and vers_high that is supported by the server.  The vers_outp argument is set to
              this value.  That is, after a successful return vers_low &lt;= *vers_outp &lt;= vers_high.  If no version between vers_low
              and vers_high is supported by the server then the routine fails and returns NULL.  A default timeout is set and can
              be modified using clnt_control().  This routine returns NULL if it fails.  The clnt_pcreateerror() routine can be
              used to print the reason for failure.  Note: clnt_create() returns a valid client handle even if the particular ver‐
              sion number supplied to clnt_create() is not registered with the rpcbind(8) service.  This mismatch will be discov‐
              ered by a clnt_call() later (see rpc_clnt_calls(3)).  However, clnt_create_vers() does this for you and returns a
              valid handle only if a version within the range supplied is supported by the server.

     clnt_create_vers_timed()
              Generic client creation routine which is similar to clnt_create_vers() but which also has the additional argument
              timeout that specifies the maximum amount of time allowed for each transport class tried.  In all other respects, the
              clnt_create_vers_timed() call behaves exactly like the clnt_create_vers() call.

     clnt_destroy()
              A function macro that destroys the client's RPC handle.  Destruction usually involves deallocation of private data
              structures, including clnt itself.  Use of clnt is undefined after calling clnt_destroy().  If the RPC library opened
              the associated file descriptor, or CLSET_FD_CLOSE was set using clnt_control(), the file descriptor will be closed.
              The caller should call auth_destroy(clnt-&gt;cl_auth) (before calling clnt_destroy()) to destroy the associated AUTH
              structure (see rpc_clnt_auth(3)).

     clnt_dg_create()
              This routine creates an RPC client for the remote program prognum and version versnum; the client uses a connection‐
              less transport.  The remote program is located at address svcaddr.  The fildes argument is an open and bound file de‐
              scriptor.  This routine will resend the call message in intervals of 15 seconds until a response is received or until
              the call times out.  The total time for the call to time out is specified by clnt_call() (see clnt_call() in
              rpc_clnt_calls(3)).  The retry time out and the total time out periods can be changed using clnt_control().  The user
              may set the size of the send and receive buffers with the sendsz and recvsz arguments; values of 0 choose suitable
              defaults.  This routine returns NULL if it fails.

     clnt_pcreateerror()
              Print a message to standard error indicating why a client RPC handle could not be created.  The message is prepended
              with the string s and a colon, and appended with a newline.

     clnt_spcreateerror()
              Like clnt_pcreateerror(), except that it returns a string instead of printing to the standard error.  A newline is
              not appended to the message in this case.  Warning: returns a pointer to a buffer that is overwritten on each call.

     clnt_raw_create()
              This routine creates an RPC client handle for the remote program prognum and version versnum.  The transport used to
              pass messages to the service is a buffer within the process's address space, so the corresponding RPC server should
              live in the same address space; (see svc_raw_create() in rpc_svc_create(3)).  This allows simulation of RPC and mea‐
              surement of RPC overheads, such as round trip times, without any kernel or networking interference.  This routine re‐
              turns NULL if it fails.  The clnt_raw_create() function should be called after svc_raw_create().

     clnt_tli_create()
              This routine creates an RPC client handle for the remote program prognum and version versnum.  The remote program is
              located at address svcaddr.  If svcaddr is NULL and it is connection-oriented, it is assumed that the file descriptor
              is connected.  For connectionless transports, if svcaddr is NULL, RPC_UNKNOWNADDR error is set.  The fildes argument
              is a file descriptor which may be open, bound and connected.  If it is RPC_ANYFD, it opens a file descriptor on the
              transport specified by netconf.  If fildes is RPC_ANYFD and netconf is NULL, a RPC_UNKNOWNPROTO error is set.  If
              fildes is unbound, then it will attempt to bind the descriptor.  The user may specify the size of the buffers with
              the sendsz and recvsz arguments; values of 0 choose suitable defaults.  Depending upon the type of the transport
              (connection-oriented or connectionless), clnt_tli_create() calls appropriate client creation routines.  This routine
              returns NULL if it fails.  The clnt_pcreateerror() routine can be used to print the reason for failure.  The remote
              rpcbind service (see rpcbind(8)) is not consulted for the address of the remote service.

     clnt_tp_create()
              Like clnt_create() except clnt_tp_create() tries only one transport specified through netconf.  The clnt_tp_create()
              function creates a client handle for the program prognum, the version versnum, and for the transport specified by
              netconf.  Default options are set, which can be changed using clnt_control() calls.  The remote rpcbind service on
              the host host is consulted for the address of the remote service.  This routine returns NULL if it fails.  The
              clnt_pcreateerror() routine can be used to print the reason for failure.

     clnt_tp_create_timed()
              Like clnt_tp_create() except clnt_tp_create_timed() has the extra argument timeout which specifies the maximum time
              allowed for the creation attempt to succeed.  In all other respects, the clnt_tp_create_timed() call behaves exactly
              like the clnt_tp_create() call.

     clnt_vc_create()
              This routine creates an RPC client for the remote program prognum and version versnum; the client uses a connection-
              oriented transport.  The remote program is located at address svcaddr.  The fildes argument is an open and bound file
              descriptor.  The user may specify the size of the send and receive buffers with the sendsz and recvsz arguments; val‐
              ues of 0 choose suitable defaults.  This routine returns NULL if it fails.  The address svcaddr should not be NULL
              and should point to the actual address of the remote program.  The clnt_vc_create() function does not consult the re‐
              mote rpcbind service for this information.

     struct rpc_createerr rpc_createerr;
              A global variable whose value is set by any RPC client handle creation routine that fails.  It is used by the routine
              clnt_pcreateerror() to print the reason for the failure.
