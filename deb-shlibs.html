NAME
       deb-shlibs - Debian shared library information file

SYNOPSIS
       debian/shlibs, debian/binary-name.shlibs, DEBIAN/shlibs

DESCRIPTION
       shlibs files map shared library names and versions (SONAMEs) to dependencies suitable for a package control file.  There is
       one entry per line. Blank lines are not allowed.  Lines beginning with a # character are considered commentary, and are
       ignored.  All other lines must have the format:

           [type:] library version dependencies

       The library and version fields are whitespace-delimited, but the dependencies field extends to the end of the line.  The
       type field is optional and normally not needed.

       The dependencies field has the same syntax as the Depends field in a binary control file, see deb-control(5).

SONAME FORMATS
       The SONAME formats supported are:

           name.so.version

       and

           name-version.so

       where name is usually prefixed by lib.

EXAMPLES
       The shlibs file for a typical library package, named libcrunch1, that provides one library whose SONAME is libcrunch.so.1,
       might read

        libcrunch 1 libcrunch1 (&gt;= 1.2-1)

       The dependencies must mention the most recent version of the package that added new symbols to the library: in the above
       example, new symbols were added to version 1.2 of libcrunch.  This is not the only reason the dependencies might need to be
       tightened.

       deb-control(5), dpkg-shlibdeps(1), deb-symbols(5).
