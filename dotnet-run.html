              dotnet run -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       The  dotnet  run  command  provides a convenient option to run your application from the source code with one command.  It’s
       useful for fast iterative development from the command line.  The command depends on the dotnet build command to  build  the
       code.  Any requirements for the build, such as that the project must be restored first, apply to dotnet run as well.

              dotnet run doesn’t respect arguments like /property:property=value, which are respected by dotnet build.

       Output  files  are written into the default location, which is bin/&lt;configuration&gt;/&lt;target&gt;.  For example if you have a net‐
       coreapp2.1 application and you run dotnet run, the output is placed in bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1.  Files  are  overwritten  as
       needed.  Temporary files are placed in the obj directory.

       If the project specifies multiple frameworks, executing dotnet run results in an error unless the -f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;
       option is used to specify the framework.

       The dotnet run command is used in the context of projects, not built assemblies.  If you’re trying to run a framework-depen‐
       dent application DLL instead, you must use dotnet without a command.  For example, to run myapp.dll, use:

              dotnet myapp.dll

       For more information on the dotnet driver, see the .NET Command Line Tools (CLI) topic.

       To  run  the application, the dotnet run command resolves the dependencies of the application that are outside of the shared
       runtime from the NuGet cache.  Because it uses cached dependencies, it’s not recommended to use dotnet run to  run  applica‐
       tions in production.  Instead, create a deployment using the dotnet publish command and deploy the published output.

   Implicit restore
       You  don’t  have  to run dotnet restore because it’s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to occur, such as
       dotnet new, dotnet build, dotnet run, dotnet test, dotnet publish, and dotnet pack.  To disable implicit  restore,  use  the
       --no-restore option.

       The  dotnet  restore command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring makes sense, such as continuous
       integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicitly control when the restore occurs.

       For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the dotnet restore documentation.

       This command supports the dotnet restore options when passed in the long form (for example, --source).  Short form  options,
       such as -s, are not supported.

   Workload manifest downloads
       When  you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads.  If the
       download is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For more information, see Advertising  mani‐
       fests.

OPTIONS
       • --

         Delimits  arguments  to  dotnet  run from arguments for the application being run.  All arguments after this delimiter are
         passed to the application run.

       • -a|--arch &lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;

         Specifies the target architecture.  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where the provid‐
         ed  value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --arch x86 sets the RID to win-
         x86.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.

       • -c|--configuration &lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;

         Defines the build configuration.  The default for most projects is Debug, but you can  override  the  build  configuration
         settings in your project.

       • -f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;

         Builds and runs the app using the specified framework.  The framework must be specified in the project file.

       • --force

         Forces  all  dependencies  to  be  resolved  even if the last restore was successful.  Specifying this flag is the same as
         deleting the project.assets.json file.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --interactive

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.   Available  since
         .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • --launch-profile &lt;NAME&gt;

         The name of the launch profile (if any) to use when launching the application.  Launch profiles are defined in the launch‐
         Settings.json file and are typically called Development, Staging, and Production.  For more information, see Working  with
         multiple environments.

       • --no-build

         Doesn’t build the project before running.  It also implicitly sets the --no-restore flag.

       • --no-dependencies

         When restoring a project with project-to-project (P2P) references, restores the root project and not the references.

       • --no-launch-profile

         Doesn’t try to use launchSettings.json to configure the application.

       • --no-restore

         Doesn’t execute an implicit restore when running the command.

       • --os &lt;OS&gt;

         Specifies  the  target  operating system (OS).  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where
         the provided value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --os  linux  sets  the
         RID to linux-x64.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6.

       • --project &lt;PATH&gt;

         Specifies  the  path  of the project file to run (folder name or full path).  If not specified, it defaults to the current
         directory.

         The -p abbreviation for --project is deprecated starting in .NET 6 SDK.  For a limited time starting in .NET 6 RC1 SDK, -p
         can  still be used for --project despite the deprecation warning.  If the argument provided for the option doesn’t contain
         =, the command accepts -p as short for --project.  Otherwise, the command assumes that -p is short for  --property.   This
         flexible use of -p for --project will be phased out in .NET 7.

       • --property:&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;

         Sets one or more MSBuild properties.  Specify multiple properties delimited by semicolons or by repeating the option:

                --property:&lt;NAME1&gt;=&lt;VALUE1&gt;;&lt;NAME2&gt;=&lt;VALUE2&gt;
                --property:&lt;NAME1&gt;=&lt;VALUE1&gt; --property:&lt;NAME2&gt;=&lt;VALUE2&gt;

         The short form -p can be used for --property.  If the argument provided for the option contains =, -p is accepted as short
         for --property.  Otherwise, the command assumes that -p is short for --project.

         To pass --property to the application rather than set an MSBuild property, provide the option after the -- syntax  separa‐
         tor, for example:

                dotnet run -- --property name=value

       • -r|--runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;

         Specifies the target runtime to restore packages for.  For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog.

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets  the  verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
         The default is minimal.  For more information, see &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.LoggerVerbosity&gt;.

EXAMPLES
       • Run the project in the current directory:

                dotnet run

       • Run the specified project:

                dotnet run --project ./projects/proj1/proj1.csproj

       • Run the project in the current directory, specifying Release configuration:

                dotnet run --property:Configuration=Release

       • Run the project in the current directory (the --help argument in this example is passed  to  the  application,  since  the
         blank -- option is used):

                dotnet run --configuration Release -- --help

       • Restore  dependencies  and  tools  for  the  project in the current directory only showing minimal output and then run the
         project:

                dotnet run --verbosity m

                                                             2022-10-10                                               dotnet-run(1)
