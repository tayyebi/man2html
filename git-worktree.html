NAME
       git-worktree - Manage multiple working trees

                          [-b &lt;new-branch&gt;] &lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;]

       git worktree unlock &lt;worktree&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.

       A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check out more than one branch at a time. With git
       worktree add a new working tree is associated with the repository, along with additional metadata that differentiates that
       working tree from others in the same repository. The working tree, along with this metadata, is called a "worktree".

       This new worktree is called a "linked worktree" as opposed to the "main worktree" prepared by git-init(1) or git-clone(1). A
       repository has one main worktree (if it’s not a bare repository) and zero or more linked worktrees. When you are done with a
       linked worktree, remove it with git worktree remove.

       In its simplest form, git worktree add &lt;path&gt; automatically creates a new branch whose name is the final component of
       &lt;path&gt;, which is convenient if you plan to work on a new topic. For instance, git worktree add ../hotfix creates new branch
       hotfix and checks it out at path ../hotfix. To instead work on an existing branch in a new worktree, use git worktree add
       &lt;path&gt; &lt;branch&gt;. On the other hand, if you just plan to make some experimental changes or do testing without disturbing
       existing development, it is often convenient to create a throwaway worktree not associated with any branch. For instance,
       git worktree add -d &lt;path&gt; creates a new worktree with a detached HEAD at the same commit as the current branch.

       If a working tree is deleted without using git worktree remove, then its associated administrative files, which reside in
       the repository (see "DETAILS" below), will eventually be removed automatically (see gc.worktreePruneExpire in git-
       config(1)), or you can run git worktree prune in the main or any linked worktree to clean up any stale administrative files.

       If the working tree for a linked worktree is stored on a portable device or network share which is not always mounted, you
       can prevent its administrative files from being pruned by issuing the git worktree lock command, optionally specifying
       --reason to explain why the worktree is locked.

COMMANDS
       add &lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;]
           Create a worktree at &lt;path&gt; and checkout &lt;commit-ish&gt; into it. The new worktree is linked to the current repository,
           sharing everything except per-worktree files such as HEAD, index, etc. As a convenience, &lt;commit-ish&gt; may be a bare "-",
           which is synonymous with @{-1}.

           If &lt;commit-ish&gt; is a branch name (call it &lt;branch&gt;) and is not found, and neither -b nor -B nor --detach are used, but
           there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it &lt;remote&gt;) with a matching name, treat as equivalent
           to:

               $ git worktree add --track -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;

           If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the checkout.defaultRemote configuration variable,
           we’ll use that one for the purposes of disambiguation, even if the &lt;branch&gt; isn’t unique across all remotes. Set it to
           e.g.  checkout.defaultRemote=origin to always checkout remote branches from there if &lt;branch&gt; is ambiguous but exists on
           the origin remote. See also checkout.defaultRemote in git-config(1).

           If &lt;commit-ish&gt; is omitted and neither -b nor -B nor --detach used, then, as a convenience, the new worktree is
           associated with a branch (call it &lt;branch&gt;) named after $(basename &lt;path&gt;). If &lt;branch&gt; doesn’t exist, a new branch
           based on HEAD is automatically created as if -b &lt;branch&gt; was given. If &lt;branch&gt; does exist, it will be checked out in
           the new worktree, if it’s not checked out anywhere else, otherwise the command will refuse to create the worktree
           (unless --force is used).

       list
           List details of each worktree. The main worktree is listed first, followed by each of the linked worktrees. The output
           details include whether the worktree is bare, the revision currently checked out, the branch currently checked out (or
           "detached HEAD" if none), "locked" if the worktree is locked, "prunable" if the worktree can be pruned by the prune
           command.

       lock
           If a worktree is on a portable device or network share which is not always mounted, lock it to prevent its
           administrative files from being pruned automatically. This also prevents it from being moved or deleted. Optionally,
           specify a reason for the lock with --reason.

       move
           Move a worktree to a new location. Note that the main worktree or linked worktrees containing submodules cannot be moved
           with this command. (The git worktree repair command, however, can reestablish the connection with linked worktrees if
           you move the main worktree manually.)

       prune
           Prune worktree information in $GIT_DIR/worktrees.

       remove
           Remove a worktree. Only clean worktrees (no untracked files and no modification in tracked files) can be removed.
           Unclean worktrees or ones with submodules can be removed with --force. The main worktree cannot be removed.

       repair [&lt;path&gt;...]
           Repair worktree administrative files, if possible, if they have become corrupted or outdated due to external factors.

           For instance, if the main worktree (or bare repository) is moved, linked worktrees will be unable to locate it. Running
           repair in the main worktree will reestablish the connection from linked worktrees back to the main worktree.

           Similarly, if the working tree for a linked worktree is moved without using git worktree move, the main worktree (or
           bare repository) will be unable to locate it. Running repair within the recently-moved worktree will reestablish the
           connection. If multiple linked worktrees are moved, running repair from any worktree with each tree’s new &lt;path&gt; as an
           argument, will reestablish the connection to all the specified paths.

           If both the main worktree and linked worktrees have been moved manually, then running repair in the main worktree and
           specifying the new &lt;path&gt; of each linked worktree will reestablish all connections in both directions.

       unlock
           Unlock a worktree, allowing it to be pruned, moved or deleted.

OPTIONS
       -f, --force
           By default, add refuses to create a new worktree when &lt;commit-ish&gt; is a branch name and is already checked out by
           another worktree, or if &lt;path&gt; is already assigned to some worktree but is missing (for instance, if &lt;path&gt; was deleted
           manually). This option overrides these safeguards. To add a missing but locked worktree path, specify --force twice.

           move refuses to move a locked worktree unless --force is specified twice. If the destination is already assigned to some
           other worktree but is missing (for instance, if &lt;new-path&gt; was deleted manually), then --force allows the move to
           proceed; use --force twice if the destination is locked.

           remove refuses to remove an unclean worktree unless --force is used. To remove a locked worktree, specify --force twice.

       -b &lt;new-branch&gt;, -B &lt;new-branch&gt;
           With add, create a new branch named &lt;new-branch&gt; starting at &lt;commit-ish&gt;, and check out &lt;new-branch&gt; into the new
           worktree. If &lt;commit-ish&gt; is omitted, it defaults to HEAD. By default, -b refuses to create a new branch if it already
           exists.  -B overrides this safeguard, resetting &lt;new-branch&gt; to &lt;commit-ish&gt;.

       -d, --detach
           With add, detach HEAD in the new worktree. See "DETACHED HEAD" in git-checkout(1).

       --[no-]checkout
           By default, add checks out &lt;commit-ish&gt;, however, --no-checkout can be used to suppress checkout in order to make
           customizations, such as configuring sparse-checkout. See "Sparse checkout" in git-read-tree(1).

       --[no-]guess-remote
           With worktree add &lt;path&gt;, without &lt;commit-ish&gt;, instead of creating a new branch from HEAD, if there exists a tracking
           branch in exactly one remote matching the basename of &lt;path&gt;, base the new branch on the remote-tracking branch, and
           mark the remote-tracking branch as "upstream" from the new branch.

           This can also be set up as the default behaviour by using the worktree.guessRemote config option.

       --[no-]track
           When creating a new branch, if &lt;commit-ish&gt; is a branch, mark it as "upstream" from the new branch. This is the default
           if &lt;commit-ish&gt; is a remote-tracking branch. See --track in git-branch(1) for details.

       --lock
           Keep the worktree locked after creation. This is the equivalent of git worktree lock after git worktree add, but without
           a race condition.

       -n, --dry-run
           With prune, do not remove anything; just report what it would remove.

       --porcelain
           With list, output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This format will remain stable across Git versions and
           regardless of user configuration. It is recommended to combine this with -z. See below for details.

       -z
           Terminate each line with a NUL rather than a newline when --porcelain is specified with list. This makes it possible to
           parse the output when a worktree path contains a newline character.

       -q, --quiet
           With add, suppress feedback messages.

       -v, --verbose
           With prune, report all removals.

           With list, output additional information about worktrees (see below).

       --expire &lt;time&gt;
           With prune, only expire unused worktrees older than &lt;time&gt;.

           With list, annotate missing worktrees as prunable if they are older than &lt;time&gt;.

       --reason &lt;string&gt;
           With lock or with add --lock, an explanation why the worktree is locked.

       &lt;worktree&gt;
           Worktrees can be identified by path, either relative or absolute.

           If the last path components in the worktree’s path is unique among worktrees, it can be used to identify a worktree. For
           example if you only have two worktrees, at /abc/def/ghi and /abc/def/ggg, then ghi or def/ghi is enough to point to the
           former worktree.

REFS
       When using multiple worktrees, some refs are shared between all worktrees, but others are specific to an individual
       worktree. One example is HEAD, which is different for each worktree. This section is about the sharing rules and how to
       access refs of one worktree from another.

       In general, all pseudo refs are per-worktree and all refs starting with refs/ are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like HEAD
       which are directly under $GIT_DIR instead of inside $GIT_DIR/refs. There are exceptions, however: refs inside refs/bisect
       and refs/worktree are not shared.

       Refs that are per-worktree can still be accessed from another worktree via two special paths, main-worktree and worktrees.
       The former gives access to per-worktree refs of the main worktree, while the latter to all linked worktrees.

       For example, main-worktree/HEAD or main-worktree/refs/bisect/good resolve to the same value as the main worktree’s HEAD and
       refs/bisect/good respectively. Similarly, worktrees/foo/HEAD or worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad are the same as
       $GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD and $GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad.

       To access refs, it’s best not to look inside $GIT_DIR directly. Instead use commands such as git-rev-parse(1) or git-update-
       ref(1) which will handle refs correctly.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       By default, the repository config file is shared across all worktrees. If the config variables core.bare or core.worktree
       are present in the common config file and extensions.worktreeConfig is disabled, then they will be applied to the main
       worktree only.

       In order to have worktree-specific configuration, you can turn on the worktreeConfig extension, e.g.:

           $ git config extensions.worktreeConfig true

       In this mode, specific configuration stays in the path pointed by git rev-parse --git-path config.worktree. You can add or
       update configuration in this file with git config --worktree. Older Git versions will refuse to access repositories with
       this extension.

       Note that in this file, the exception for core.bare and core.worktree is gone. If they exist in $GIT_DIR/config, you must
       move them to the config.worktree of the main worktree. You may also take this opportunity to review and move other
       configuration that you do not want to share to all worktrees:

       •   core.worktree should never be shared.

       •   core.bare should not be shared if the value is core.bare=true.

       •   core.sparseCheckout should not be shared, unless you are sure you always use sparse checkout for all worktrees.

       See the documentation of extensions.worktreeConfig in git-config(1) for more details.

DETAILS
       Each linked worktree has a private sub-directory in the repository’s $GIT_DIR/worktrees directory. The private
       sub-directory’s name is usually the base name of the linked worktree’s path, possibly appended with a number to make it
       unique. For example, when $GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git the command git worktree add /path/other/test-next next creates the
       linked worktree in /path/other/test-next and also creates a $GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next directory (or
       $GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1 if test-next is already taken).

       Within a linked worktree, $GIT_DIR is set to point to this private directory (e.g. /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next in
       the example) and $GIT_COMMON_DIR is set to point back to the main worktree’s $GIT_DIR (e.g. /path/main/.git). These settings
       are made in a .git file located at the top directory of the linked worktree.

       Path resolution via git rev-parse --git-path uses either $GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR depending on the path. For example, in
       the linked worktree git rev-parse --git-path HEAD returns /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD (not
       /path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD or /path/main/.git/HEAD) while git rev-parse --git-path refs/heads/master uses
       $GIT_COMMON_DIR and returns /path/main/.git/refs/heads/master, since refs are shared across all worktrees, except
       refs/bisect and refs/worktree.

       See gitrepository-layout(5) for more information. The rule of thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path
       belongs to $GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR when you need to directly access something inside $GIT_DIR. Use git rev-parse
       --git-path to get the final path.

       If you manually move a linked worktree, you need to update the gitdir file in the entry’s directory. For example, if a
       linked worktree is moved to /newpath/test-next and its .git file points to /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next, then update
       /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir to reference /newpath/test-next instead. Better yet, run git worktree repair to
       reestablish the connection automatically.

       To prevent a $GIT_DIR/worktrees entry from being pruned (which can be useful in some situations, such as when the entry’s
       worktree is stored on a portable device), use the git worktree lock command, which adds a file named locked to the entry’s
       directory. The file contains the reason in plain text. For example, if a linked worktree’s .git file points to
       /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next then a file named /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked will prevent the test-next
       entry from being pruned. See gitrepository-layout(5) for details.

       When extensions.worktreeConfig is enabled, the config file .git/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree is read after .git/config is.

LIST OUTPUT FORMAT
       The worktree list command has two output formats. The default format shows the details on a single line with columns. For
       example:

           $ git worktree list
           /path/to/bare-source            (bare)
           /path/to/linked-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
           /path/to/other-linked-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)

       The command also shows annotations for each worktree, according to its state. These annotations are:

       •   locked, if the worktree is locked.

       •   prunable, if the worktree can be pruned via git worktree prune.

           $ git worktree list
           /path/to/linked-worktree    abcd1234 [master]
           /path/to/locked-worktree    acbd5678 (brancha) locked
           /path/to/prunable-worktree  5678abc  (detached HEAD) prunable

       For these annotations, a reason might also be available and this can be seen using the verbose mode. The annotation is then
       moved to the next line indented followed by the additional information.

           $ git worktree list --verbose
           /path/to/linked-worktree              abcd1234 [master]
           /path/to/locked-worktree-no-reason    abcd5678 (detached HEAD) locked
           /path/to/locked-worktree-with-reason  1234abcd (brancha)
                   locked: worktree path is mounted on a portable device
           /path/to/prunable-worktree            5678abc1 (detached HEAD)
                   prunable: gitdir file points to non-existent location

       Note that the annotation is moved to the next line if the additional information is available, otherwise it stays on the
       same line as the worktree itself.

   Porcelain Format
       The porcelain format has a line per attribute. If -z is given then the lines are terminated with NUL rather than a newline.
       Attributes are listed with a label and value separated by a single space. Boolean attributes (like bare and detached) are
       listed as a label only, and are present only if the value is true. Some attributes (like locked) can be listed as a label
       only or with a value depending upon whether a reason is available. The first attribute of a worktree is always worktree, an
       empty line indicates the end of the record. For example:

           $ git worktree list --porcelain
           worktree /path/to/bare-source
           bare

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree
           HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234
           branch refs/heads/master

           worktree /path/to/other-linked-worktree
           HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a
           detached

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-no-reason
           HEAD 5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678c
           branch refs/heads/locked-no-reason
           locked

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-with-reason
           HEAD 3456def3456def3456def3456def3456def3456b
           branch refs/heads/locked-with-reason
           locked reason why is locked

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-prunable
           HEAD 1233def1234def1234def1234def1234def1234b
           detached
           prunable gitdir file points to non-existent location

       Unless -z is used any "unusual" characters in the lock reason such as newlines are escaped and the entire reason is quoted
       as explained for the configuration variable core.quotePath (see git-config(1)). For Example:

           $ git worktree list --porcelain
           ...
           locked "reason\nwhy is locked"
           ...

EXAMPLES
       You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in and demands that you fix something immediately. You
       might typically use git-stash(1) to store your changes away temporarily, however, your working tree is in such a state of
       disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don’t want to risk
       disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary linked worktree to make the emergency fix, remove it when done, and
       then resume your earlier refactoring session.

           $ git worktree add -b emergency-fix ../temp master
           $ pushd ../temp
           # ... hack hack hack ...

       make multiple checkouts of a superproject.
