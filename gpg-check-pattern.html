NAME
       gpg-check-pattern - Check a passphrase on stdin against the patternfile

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-check-pattern [options] patternfile

DESCRIPTION
       gpg-check-pattern checks a passphrase given on stdin against a specified pattern file.

       The pattern file is line based with comment lines beginning on the first position with a #.  Empty lines and lines with only
       white spaces are ignored.  The actual pattern lines may either be verbatim string pattern and match as  they  are  (trailing
       spaces  are  ignored) or extended regular expressions indicated by a / or !/ in the first column and terminated by another /
       or end of line.  If a regular expression starts with !/ the match result is reversed. By default all  comparisons  are  case
       insensitive.

       Tag lines may be used to further control the operation of this tool.  The currently defined tags are:

       [icase]
              Switch to case insensitive comparison for all further patterns.  This is the default.

       [case] Switch to case sensitive comparison for all further patterns.

       [reject]
              Switch to reject mode.  This is the default mode.

       [accept]
              Switch to accept mode.

       In the future more tags may be introduced and thus it is advisable not to start a plain pattern string with an open bracket.
       The tags must be given verbatim on the line with no spaces to the left or any non white space characters to the right.

       In reject mode the program exits on the first match with an exit code of 1 (failure).  If at the end of the pattern list the
       reject mode is still active the program exits with code 0 (success).

       In accept mode blocks of patterns are used.  A block starts at the next pattern after an "accept" tag and ends with the last
       pattern before the next "accept" or "reject" tag or at the end of the pattern list.  If all patterns in a  block  match  the
       program exits with an exit code of 0 (success).  If any pattern in a block do not match the next pattern block is evaluated.
       If at the end of the pattern list the accept mode is still active the program exits with code 1 (failure).

OPTIONS
       --verbose
              Enable extra informational output.

       --check
              Run only a syntax check on the patternfile.

       --null Input is expected to be null delimited.
