NAME
       desktop-file-install, desktop-file-edit - Installation and edition of desktop files

SYNOPSIS
       desktop-file-install  [--dir=DIR]  [-m  MODE|--mode=MODE]  [--vendor=VENDOR] [--delete-original] [--rebuild-mime-info-cache]
       [EDITOPTION]... FILE...

       desktop-file-edit [EDITOPTION]... FILE

DESCRIPTION
       The desktop-file-install program is a tool to install, and optionally edit, desktop files. The desktop-file-edit program  is
       a tool to edit a desktop file. They are mostly useful for developers and packagers.

       Various  options  are available to edit the desktop files. The edit options can be specified more than once and will be pro‐
       cessed in the same order as the options passed to the program.

       desktop-file-install and desktop-file-edit will always try to validate the resulting desktop file.  A  failure  to  validate
       might lead to the abortion of the installation of the desktop files.

       The  list  of  registered  categories  and  desktop  environments  is  defined  in  the Menu specification: http://freedesk‐
       top.org/wiki/Specifications/menu-spec.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --dir=DIR
              Install desktop files to the DIR directory.

       -m, --mode=MODE
              Set the permissions of the destination files to MODE.

       --vendor=VENDOR
              Add a vendor prefix to the desktop files. If a file already has this prefix, nothing happens; else, the file will  be
              named  VENDOR-FILE. For example: if VENDOR is freedesktop.org and FILE is specification.desktop, the result file will
              be freedesktop.org-specification.desktop.

       --delete-original
              Delete the source desktop files, leaving only the target files.  Effectively "renames" the desktop files.

       --rebuild-mime-info-cache
              Rebuild the MIME types application database after installing the desktop files.  See  update-desktop-database(1)  for
              information about this database.

EDIT OPTIONS
       The following edit options are supported:

       --set-key=KEY
              Set the KEY key to the value passed to the next --set-value option. A matching --set-value option is mandatory.

       --set-value=VALUE
              Set the key specified with the previous --set-key option to VALUE.  A matching --set-key option is mandatory.

       --set-name=NAME
              Set the name (key Name) to NAME. If a name was already set, it will be overridden. Localizations of the old name will
              be removed.

       --copy-name-to-generic-name
              Copy the value of the Name key to the GenericName key. Note that a desktop file requires a Name key to be  valid,  so
              this option will always have an effect.

       --set-generic-name=GENERIC-NAME
              Set the generic name (key GenericName) to GENERIC-NAME. If a generic name was already set, it will be overridden. Lo‐
              calizations of the old generic name will be removed.

       --copy-generic-name-to-name
              Copy the value of the GenericName key to the Name key, if the GenericName key is present.

       --set-comment=COMMENT
              Set the comment (key Comment) to COMMENT. If a comment was already set, it will be overridden. Localizations  of  the
              old comment will be removed.

       --set-icon=ICON
              Set  the  icon  (key  Icon) to ICON. If an icon was already set, it will be overridden. Localizations of the old icon
              will be removed.

       --add-category=CATEGORY
              Add CATEGORY to the list of categories (key Categories). If CATEGORY was already present in the list, this  operation
              is a no-op. A non-registered category should be prefixed with X-.

       --remove-category=CATEGORY
              Remove CATEGORY from the list of categories (key Categories). If CATEGORY was not present in the list, this operation
              is a no-op.

       --add-mime-type=MIME-TYPE
              Add MIME-TYPE to the list of MIME types (key MimeType). If MIME-TYPE was already present in the list, this  operation
              is a no-op.

       --remove-mime-type=MIME-TYPE
              Remove  MIME-TYPE  from the list of MIME types (key MimeType).  If MIME-TYPE was not present in the list, this opera‐
              tion is a no-op.

       --add-only-show-in=ENVIRONMENT
              Add ENVIRONMENT to the list of desktop environments where the desktop files should be displayed (key OnlyShowIn).  If
              ENVIRONMENT  was  already present in the list, this operation is a no-op. A non-registered desktop environment should
              be prefixed with X-. Note that an empty OnlyShowIn key in a desktop file means that the desktop  file  will  be  dis‐
              played in all environments.

       --remove-only-show-in=ENVIRONMENT
              Remove  ENVIRONMENT  from  the  list  of  desktop  environments  where  the  desktop  files  should be displayed (key
              OnlyShowIn). If ENVIRONMENT was not present in the list, this operation is a no-op.

       --add-not-show-in=ENVIRONMENT
              Add ENVIRONMENT to the list of desktop environments where the desktop files should not be displayed (key  NotShowIn).
              If  ENVIRONMENT  was  already  present  in  the list, this operation is a no-op. A non-registered desktop environment
              should be prefixed with X-. Note that an empty NotShowIn key in a desktop file means that the desktop  file  will  be
              displayed in all environments.

       --remove-not-show-in=ENVIRONMENT
              Remove  ENVIRONMENT  from  the list of desktop environments where the desktop files should not be displayed (key Not‐
              ShowIn). If ENVIRONMENT was not present in the list, this operation is a no-op.

       --remove-key=KEY
              Remove the KEY key from the desktop files, if present.

ENVIRONMENT
       Some environment variables change the behavior of desktop-file-install:

       DESKTOP_FILE_VENDOR

              This variable can be used as an alternative to the --vendor option. If the --vendor option is used, this  environment
              variable will be ignored.

       DESKTOP_FILE_INSTALL_DIR

              This  variable can be used as an alternative to the --dir option. If the --dir option is used, this environment vari‐
              able will be ignored.

       RPM_BUILD_ROOT

              This variable is set when building RPM packages. If the --dir option  and  the  DESKTOP_FILE_INSTALL_DIR  environment
              variable  are  not  used,  it will automatically be prepended to the default install directory to install the desktop
              files appropriately when building packages.
