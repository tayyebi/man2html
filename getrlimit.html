NAME
       getrlimit, setrlimit, prlimit - get/set resource limits

       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;

       int getrlimit(int resource, struct rlimit *rlim);
       int setrlimit(int resource, const struct rlimit *rlim);

       int prlimit(pid_t pid, int resource,
                   const struct rlimit *_Nullable new_limit,

       prlimit():
           _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The  getrlimit()  and  setrlimit()  system calls get and set resource limits.  Each resource has an associated soft and hard
       limit, as defined by the rlimit structure:

           struct rlimit {
               rlim_t rlim_cur;  /* Soft limit */
               rlim_t rlim_max;  /* Hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur) */
           };

       The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resource.  The hard limit acts as a  ceiling  for
       the soft limit: an unprivileged process may set only its soft limit to a value in the range from 0 up to the hard limit, and
       (irreversibly) lower its hard limit.  A privileged process (under Linux: one with the  CAP_SYS_RESOURCE  capability  in  the
       initial user namespace) may make arbitrary changes to either limit value.

       The  value  RLIM_INFINITY denotes no limit on a resource (both in the structure returned by getrlimit() and in the structure
       passed to setrlimit()).

       The resource argument must be one of:

       RLIMIT_AS
              This is the maximum size of the process's virtual memory (address space).  The limit is specified in  bytes,  and  is
              rounded  down  to  the system page size.  This limit affects calls to brk(2), mmap(2), and mremap(2), which fail with
              the error ENOMEM upon exceeding this limit.  In addition, automatic stack expansion fails (and  generates  a  SIGSEGV
              that kills the process if no alternate stack has been made available via sigaltstack(2)).  Since the value is a long,
              on machines with a 32-bit long either this limit is at most 2 GiB, or this resource is unlimited.

       RLIMIT_CORE
              This is the maximum size of a core file (see core(5)) in bytes that the process may dump.  When 0 no core dump  files
              are created.  When nonzero, larger dumps are truncated to this size.

       RLIMIT_CPU
              This  is  a  limit, in seconds, on the amount of CPU time that the process can consume.  When the process reaches the
              soft limit, it is sent a SIGXCPU signal.  The default action for this signal is to terminate the  process.   However,
              the  signal  can be caught, and the handler can return control to the main program.  If the process continues to con‐
              sume CPU time, it will be sent SIGXCPU once per second until the hard limit is reached, at  which  time  it  is  sent
              SIGKILL.   (This  latter point describes Linux behavior.  Implementations vary in how they treat processes which con‐
              tinue to consume CPU time after reaching the soft limit.  Portable applications that need to catch this signal should
              perform an orderly termination upon first receipt of SIGXCPU.)

       RLIMIT_DATA
              This  is  the maximum size of the process's data segment (initialized data, uninitialized data, and heap).  The limit
              is specified in bytes, and is rounded down to the system page size.  This limit affects calls to brk(2), sbrk(2), and
              (since Linux 4.7) mmap(2), which fail with the error ENOMEM upon encountering the soft limit of this resource.

       RLIMIT_FSIZE
              This  is the maximum size in bytes of files that the process may create.  Attempts to extend a file beyond this limit
              result in delivery of a SIGXFSZ signal.  By default, this signal terminates a process, but a process can  catch  this
              signal instead, in which case the relevant system call (e.g., write(2), truncate(2)) fails with the error EFBIG.

       RLIMIT_LOCKS (Linux 2.4.0 to Linux 2.4.24)
              This is a limit on the combined number of flock(2) locks and fcntl(2) leases that this process may establish.

       RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
              This  is  the maximum number of bytes of memory that may be locked into RAM.  This limit is in effect rounded down to
              the nearest multiple of the system page size.  This limit affects mlock(2), mlockall(2), and the  mmap(2)  MAP_LOCKED
              operation.  Since Linux 2.6.9, it also affects the shmctl(2) SHM_LOCK operation, where it sets a maximum on the total
              bytes in shared memory segments (see shmget(2)) that may be locked by the real user ID of the calling  process.   The
              shmctl(2)  SHM_LOCK  locks  are  accounted  for separately from the per-process memory locks established by mlock(2),
              mlockall(2), and mmap(2) MAP_LOCKED; a process can lock bytes up to this limit in each of these two categories.

              Before Linux 2.6.9, this limit controlled the amount of memory that could be locked by a privileged  process.   Since
              Linux  2.6.9, no limits are placed on the amount of memory that a privileged process may lock, and this limit instead
              governs the amount of memory that an unprivileged process may lock.

       RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE (since Linux 2.6.8)
              This is a limit on the number of bytes that can be allocated for POSIX message queues for the real  user  ID  of  the
              calling  process.   This limit is enforced for mq_open(3).  Each message queue that the user creates counts (until it
              is removed) against this limit according to the formula:

                  Since Linux 3.5:

                      bytes = attr.mq_maxmsg * sizeof(struct msg_msg) +
                              MIN(attr.mq_maxmsg, MQ_PRIO_MAX) *
                                    sizeof(struct posix_msg_tree_node)+
                                              /* For overhead */
                              attr.mq_maxmsg * attr.mq_msgsize;
                                              /* For message data */

                  Linux 3.4 and earlier:

                      bytes = attr.mq_maxmsg * sizeof(struct msg_msg *) +
                                              /* For overhead */
                              attr.mq_maxmsg * attr.mq_msgsize;
                                              /* For message data */

              where attr is  the  mq_attr  structure  specified  as  the  fourth  argument  to  mq_open(3),  and  the  msg_msg  and
              posix_msg_tree_node structures are kernel-internal structures.

              The  "overhead" addend in the formula accounts for overhead bytes required by the implementation and ensures that the
              user cannot create an unlimited number of zero-length messages (such messages nevertheless each consume  some  system
              memory for bookkeeping overhead).

       RLIMIT_NICE (since Linux 2.6.12, but see BUGS below)
              This specifies a ceiling to which the process's nice value can be raised using setpriority(2) or nice(2).  The actual
              ceiling for the nice value is calculated as 20 - rlim_cur.  The useful range for this limit is thus  from  1  (corre‐
              sponding  to a nice value of 19) to 40 (corresponding to a nice value of -20).  This unusual choice of range was nec‐
              essary because negative numbers cannot be specified as resource limit values, since they typically have special mean‐
              ings.  For example, RLIM_INFINITY typically is the same as -1.  For more detail on the nice value, see sched(7).

       RLIMIT_NOFILE
              This  specifies  a value one greater than the maximum file descriptor number that can be opened by this process.  At‐
              tempts (open(2), pipe(2), dup(2), etc.)  to exceed this limit yield the error EMFILE.  (Historically, this limit  was
              named RLIMIT_OFILE on BSD.)

              Since  Linux  4.5,  this  limit also defines the maximum number of file descriptors that an unprivileged process (one
              without the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability) may have "in flight" to other processes, by being passed across UNIX  domain
              sockets.  This limit applies to the sendmsg(2) system call.  For further details, see unix(7).

       RLIMIT_NPROC
              This  is  a  limit on the number of extant process (or, more precisely on Linux, threads) for the real user ID of the
              calling process.  So long as the current number of processes belonging to this process's real user ID is greater than
              or equal to this limit, fork(2) fails with the error EAGAIN.

              The RLIMIT_NPROC limit is not enforced for processes that have either the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capa‐
              bility, or run with real user ID 0.

       RLIMIT_RSS
              This is a limit (in bytes) on the process's resident set (the number of virtual pages resident in RAM).   This  limit
              has effect only in Linux 2.4.x, x &lt; 30, and there affects only calls to madvise(2) specifying MADV_WILLNEED.

       RLIMIT_RTPRIO (since Linux 2.6.12, but see BUGS)
              This  specifies  a ceiling on the real-time priority that may be set for this process using sched_setscheduler(2) and
              sched_setparam(2).

              For further details on real-time scheduling policies, see sched(7)

       RLIMIT_RTTIME (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This is a limit (in microseconds) on the amount of CPU time that a process scheduled  under  a  real-time  scheduling
              policy may consume without making a blocking system call.  For the purpose of this limit, each time a process makes a
              blocking system call, the count of its consumed CPU time is reset to zero.  The CPU time count is not  reset  if  the
              process continues trying to use the CPU but is preempted, its time slice expires, or it calls sched_yield(2).

              Upon  reaching  the  soft limit, the process is sent a SIGXCPU signal.  If the process catches or ignores this signal
              and continues consuming CPU time, then SIGXCPU will be generated once each second until the hard limit is reached, at
              which point the process is sent a SIGKILL signal.

              The intended use of this limit is to stop a runaway real-time process from locking up the system.

              For further details on real-time scheduling policies, see sched(7)

       RLIMIT_SIGPENDING (since Linux 2.6.8)
              This  is a limit on the number of signals that may be queued for the real user ID of the calling process.  Both stan‐
              dard and real-time signals are counted for the purpose of checking this limit.  However, the limit is  enforced  only
              for  sigqueue(3);  it  is always possible to use kill(2) to queue one instance of any of the signals that are not al‐
              ready queued to the process.

       RLIMIT_STACK
              This is the maximum size of the process stack, in bytes.  Upon reaching this limit, a SIGSEGV  signal  is  generated.
              To handle this signal, a process must employ an alternate signal stack (sigaltstack(2)).

              Since  Linux 2.6.23, this limit also determines the amount of space used for the process's command-line arguments and
              environment variables; for details, see execve(2).

   prlimit()
       The Linux-specific prlimit() system call combines and extends the functionality of setrlimit() and getrlimit().  It  can  be
       used to both set and get the resource limits of an arbitrary process.

       The resource argument has the same meaning as for setrlimit() and getrlimit().

       If  the  new_limit argument is not NULL, then the rlimit structure to which it points is used to set new values for the soft
       and hard limits for resource.  If the old_limit argument is not NULL, then a successful call to prlimit() places the  previ‐
       ous soft and hard limits for resource in the rlimit structure pointed to by old_limit.

       The pid argument specifies the ID of the process on which the call is to operate.  If pid is 0, then the call applies to the
       calling process.  To set or get the resources of a process other than itself, the caller must have the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE  ca‐
       pability in the user namespace of the process whose resource limits are being changed, or the real, effective, and saved set
       user IDs of the target process must match the real user ID of the caller and the real, effective, and saved set group IDs of
       the target process must match the real group ID of the caller.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these system calls return 0.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT A pointer argument points to a location outside the accessible address space.

       EINVAL The  value  specified  in  resource  is  not valid; or, for setrlimit() or prlimit(): rlim-&gt;rlim_cur was greater than
              rlim-&gt;rlim_max.

       EPERM  An unprivileged process tried to raise the hard limit; the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability is required to do this.

       EPERM  The caller tried to increase the hard RLIMIT_NOFILE limit above the  maximum  defined  by  /proc/sys/fs/nr_open  (see
              proc(5))

       EPERM  (prlimit()) The calling process did not have permission to set limits for the process specified by pid.

       ESRCH  Could not find a process with the ID specified in pid.

VERSIONS
       The prlimit() system call is available since Linux 2.6.36.  Library support is available since glibc 2.13.

STANDARDS
       getrlimit(), setrlimit(): POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

       prlimit(): Linux-specific.

       RLIMIT_MEMLOCK  and  RLIMIT_NPROC  derive from BSD and are not specified in POSIX.1; they are present on the BSDs and Linux,
       but on few other implementations.  RLIMIT_RSS derives from BSD and is not specified in POSIX.1; it is  nevertheless  present
       on  most  implementations.  RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE, RLIMIT_NICE, RLIMIT_RTPRIO, RLIMIT_RTTIME, and RLIMIT_SIGPENDING are Linux-spe‐
       cific.

NOTES
       A child process created via fork(2) inherits its parent's resource limits.  Resource limits are preserved across execve(2).

       Resource limits are per-process attributes that are shared by all of the threads in a process.

       Lowering the soft limit for a resource below the process's current consumption of that resource will succeed (but will  pre‐
       vent the process from further increasing its consumption of the resource).

       One can set the resource limits of the shell using the built-in ulimit command (limit in csh(1)).  The shell's resource lim‐
       its are inherited by the processes that it creates to execute commands.

       Since Linux 2.6.24, the resource limits of any process can be inspected via /proc/pid/limits; see proc(5).

       Ancient systems provided a vlimit() function with a similar purpose to setrlimit().  For backward compatibility, glibc  also
       provides vlimit().  All new applications should be written using setrlimit().

   C library/kernel ABI differences
       Since  glibc  2.13, the glibc getrlimit() and setrlimit() wrapper functions no longer invoke the corresponding system calls,
       but instead employ prlimit(), for the reasons described in BUGS.

       The name of the glibc wrapper function is prlimit(); the underlying system call is prlimit64().

BUGS
       In older Linux kernels, the SIGXCPU and SIGKILL signals delivered when a process encountered the soft  and  hard  RLIMIT_CPU
       limits were delivered one (CPU) second later than they should have been.  This was fixed in Linux 2.6.8.

       In  Linux  2.6.x kernels before Linux 2.6.17, a RLIMIT_CPU limit of 0 is wrongly treated as "no limit" (like RLIM_INFINITY).
       Since Linux 2.6.17, setting a limit of 0 does have an effect, but is actually treated as a limit of 1 second.

       A kernel bug means that RLIMIT_RTPRIO does not work in Linux 2.6.12; the problem is fixed in Linux 2.6.13.

       In Linux 2.6.12, there was an off-by-one mismatch between the priority ranges returned by  getpriority(2)  and  RLIMIT_NICE.
       This  had  the  effect  that the actual ceiling for the nice value was calculated as 19 - rlim_cur.  This was fixed in Linux
       2.6.13.

       Since Linux 2.6.12, if a process reaches its soft RLIMIT_CPU limit and has a handler installed for SIGXCPU, then,  in  addi‐
       tion  to  invoking  the  signal  handler,  the  kernel increases the soft limit by one second.  This behavior repeats if the
       process continues to consume CPU time, until the hard limit is reached, at which point the process is killed.  Other  imple‐
       mentations  do not change the RLIMIT_CPU soft limit in this manner, and the Linux behavior is probably not standards confor‐
       mant; portable applications should avoid relying on this Linux-specific behavior.  The  Linux-specific  RLIMIT_RTTIME  limit
       exhibits the same behavior when the soft limit is encountered.

       Kernels  before  Linux  2.4.22  did  not  diagnose  the  error  EINVAL  for setrlimit() when rlim-&gt;rlim_cur was greater than
       rlim-&gt;rlim_max.

       Linux doesn't return an error when an attempt to set RLIMIT_CPU has failed, for compatibility reasons.

   Representation of "large" resource limit values on 32-bit platforms
       The glibc getrlimit() and setrlimit() wrapper functions use a 64-bit rlim_t data type, even on 32-bit  platforms.   However,
       the rlim_t data type used in the getrlimit() and setrlimit() system calls is a (32-bit) unsigned long.  Furthermore, in Lin‐
       ux, the kernel represents resource limits on 32-bit platforms as unsigned long.  However, a 32-bit data  type  is  not  wide
       enough.   The  most  pertinent  limit here is RLIMIT_FSIZE, which specifies the maximum size to which a file can grow: to be
       useful, this limit must be represented using a type that is as wide as the type used to represent file offsets—that  is,  as
       wide as a 64-bit off_t (assuming a program compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64).

       To  work around this kernel limitation, if a program tried to set a resource limit to a value larger than can be represented
       in a 32-bit unsigned long, then the glibc setrlimit() wrapper function silently converted the limit value to  RLIM_INFINITY.
       In other words, the requested resource limit setting was silently ignored.

       Since  glibc  2.13, glibc works around the limitations of the getrlimit() and setrlimit() system calls by implementing setr‐
       limit() and getrlimit() as wrapper functions that call prlimit().
