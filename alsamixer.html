NAME
       alsamixer - soundcard mixer for ALSA soundcard driver, with ncurses interface

SYNOPSIS
       alsamixer [options]

DESCRIPTION
       alsamixer is an ncurses mixer program for use with the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple soundcards with multiple
       devices.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show available flags.

       -c, --card &lt;card number or identification&gt;
              Select the soundcard to use, if you have more than one. Cards are numbered from 0 (the default).

       -D, --device &lt;device identification&gt;
              Select the mixer device to control.

       -V, --view &lt;mode&gt;
              Select the starting view mode, either playback, capture or all.

       -g, --no-color
              Toggle the using of colors.

MIXER VIEWS
       The top-left corner of alsamixer shows some basic information: the card name, the mixer chip name, the current view mode and
       the currently selected mixer item.  When the mixer item is switched off, [Off] is displayed in its name.

       Volume  bars  are  located  below the basic information area.  You can scroll left/right when all controls can't be put in a
       single screen.  The name of each control is shown in the bottom below the volume bars.  The currently selected item is drawn
       in red and/or emphasized.

       Each mixer control with volume capability shows a box and the current volume filled in that box.  The volume percentages are
       displayed below the volume bar for left and right channels.  For a mono control, only one value is shown there.

       When a mixer control is turned off, M (mute) appears below the volume bar.  When it's turned on, O in green appears instead.
       You can toggle the switch via m key.

       When a mixer control has capture capability, the capture flag appears below the volume bar, too.  When the capture is turned
       off, ------- is shown.  CAPTURE in red appears when the capture switch is turned on.  In addition, L and R letters appear in
       left and right side to indicate that left and the right channels are turned on.

       Some  controls have the enumeration list, and don't show boxes but only texts which indicate the currently active item.  You
       can change the item via up/down keys.

VIEW MODES
       alsamixer has three view modes: playback, capture and all.  In the playback view, only the controls  related  with  playback
       are shown.  Similarly, only the controls for capture (recording) are shown in the capture view.  The all view mode shows all
       controls.  The current view mode is displayed in the top-left position together with the mixer name, etc.

       The default view mode is the playback view.  You can change it via -V option.

       Each view mode can be switched via keyboard commands, too.  See the next section.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
       alsamixer recognizes the following keyboard commands to control the soundcard.  Commands shown here in upper case  can  also
       be given in lower case.  To be reminded of these keystrokes, hit the h key.

   General Controls
       The  Left  and right arrow keys are used to select the channel (or device, depending on your preferred terminology). You can
       also use n ("next") and p ("previous").

       The Up and Down Arrows control the volume for the currently selected device. You can also use + or - for the  same  purpose.
       Both the left and right signals are affected. For independent left and right control, see below.

       The B or = key adjusts the balance of volumes on left and right channels.

       M  toggles  muting  for the current channel (both left and right).  If the hardware supports it, you can mute left and right
       independently by using , (or &lt;) and . (or &gt;) respectively.

       SPACE enables recording for the current channel. If any other channels have recording enabled, they will have their  record‐
       ing function disabled first. This only works for valid input channels, of course.

       L re-draws the screen.

   View Mode Controls
       Function keys are used to change view modes.  You can switch to the help mode and the proc info mode via F1 and F2 keys, re‐
       spectively.  On terminals that can't use function keys like gnome-terminal, ? and / keys can be used alternatively for  help
       and proc modes.

       F3,  F4  and  F5  keys are used to switch to playback, capture and all view mode, respectively.  TAB key toggles the current
       view mode circularly.

   Quick Volume Changes
       PageUp increases volume by 5.

       PageDown decreases volume by 5.

       End sets volume to 0.

       You can also control left &amp; right levels for the current channel independently, as follows:

       [Q | W | E ]  -- turn UP [ left | both | right ]

       [Z | X | C ] -- turn DOWN [ left | both | right ]

       If the currently selected mixer channel is not a stereo channel, then all UP keys will work like W, and all DOWN  keys  will
       work like X.

       The number keys from 0 to 9 are to change the absolute volume quickly.  They correspond to 0 to 90% volume.

   Selecting the Sound Card
       You  can  select  another sound card by pressing the F6 or S keys.  This will show a list of available sound cards to choose
       from, and an entry to enter the mixer device name by hand.

   Exiting
       Quit the program with ALT Q, or by hitting ESC.  Please note that you might need to hit ESC twice on  some  terminals  since
       it's regarded as a prefix key.

VOLUME MAPPING
       In alsamixer, the volume is mapped to a value that is more natural for a human ear.  The mapping is designed so that the po‐
       sition in the interval is proportional to the volume as a human ear would perceive it, i.e. the position is the  cubic  root
       of  the  linear sample multiplication factor.  For controls with a small range (24 dB or less), the mapping is linear in the
       dB values so that each step has the same size visually.

       Only for controls without dB information, a linear mapping of the hardware volume register values is used (this is the  same
       algorithm as used in the old alsamixer).

FILES
       Configuration is read from the following files:

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alsamixer.rc

       $HOME/.config/alsamixer.rc
