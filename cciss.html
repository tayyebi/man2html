NAME
       cciss - HP Smart Array block driver

SYNOPSIS
       modprobe cciss [ cciss_allow_hpsa=1 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Note: This obsolete driver was removed in Linux 4.14, as it is superseded by the hpsa(4) driver in newer kernels.

       cciss is a block driver for older HP Smart Array RAID controllers.

   Options
       cciss_allow_hpsa=1:  This  option prevents the cciss driver from attempting to drive any controllers that the hpsa(4) driver
       is capable of controlling, which is to say, the cciss driver is restricted by this option to the following controllers:

           Smart Array 5300
           Smart Array 5i
           Smart Array 532
           Smart Array 5312
           Smart Array 641
           Smart Array 642
           Smart Array 6400
           Smart Array 6400 EM
           Smart Array 6i
           Smart Array P600
           Smart Array P400i

   Configuration details
       To configure HP Smart Array controllers, use the HP Array Configuration Utility (either hpacuxe(8) or  hpacucli(8))  or  the
       Offline ROM-based Configuration Utility (ORCA) run from the Smart Array's option ROM at boot time.

              A symbolic link to /sys/block/cciss!cXdY.

       /sys/bus/pci/devices/&lt;dev&gt;/ccissX/rescan
              When  this  file  is  written to, the driver rescans the controller to discover any new, removed, or modified logical
              drives.

       /sys/bus/pci/devices/&lt;dev&gt;/ccissX/resettable
              A value of 1 displayed in this file indicates that the "reset_devices=1" kernel parameter (used by kdump) is  honored
              by  this  controller.   A value of 0 indicates that the "reset_devices=1" kernel parameter will not be honored.  Some
              models of Smart Array are not able to honor this parameter.

              Displays the RAID level of logical drive Y of controller X.

       /sys/bus/pci/devices/&lt;dev&gt;/ccissX/cXdY/usage_count
              Displays the usage count (number of opens) of logical drive Y of controller X.

   SCSI tape drive and medium changer support
       SCSI sequential access devices and medium changer devices are supported and appropriate device nodes are automatically  cre‐
       ated (e.g., /dev/st0, /dev/st1, etc.; see st(4) for more details.)  You must enable "SCSI tape drive support for Smart Array
       5xxx" and "SCSI support" in your kernel configuration to be able to use SCSI tape drives with your  Smart  Array  5xxx  con‐
       troller.

       Additionally,  note  that the driver will not engage the SCSI core at init time.  The driver must be directed to dynamically
       engage  the  SCSI  core  via  the  /proc  filesystem  entry,  which  the   "block"   side   of   the   driver   creates   as
       /proc/driver/cciss/cciss*  at  run time.  This is because at driver init time, the SCSI core may not yet be initialized (be‐
       cause the driver is a block driver) and attempting to register it with the SCSI core in such a  case  would  cause  a  hang.
       This  is  best  done via an initialization script (typically in /etc/init.d, but could vary depending on distribution).  For
       example:

           for x in /proc/driver/cciss/cciss[0-9]*
           do
               echo "engage scsi" &gt; $x
           done

       Once the SCSI core is engaged by the driver, it cannot be disengaged (except by unloading the driver, if it  happens  to  be
       linked as a module.)

       Note also that if no sequential access devices or medium changers are detected, the SCSI core will not be engaged by the ac‐
       tion of the above script.

   Hot plug support for SCSI tape drives
       Hot plugging of SCSI tape drives is supported, with some caveats.  The cciss driver must be informed  that  changes  to  the
       SCSI bus have been made.  This may be done via the /proc filesystem.  For example:

              echo "rescan" &gt; /proc/scsi/cciss0/1

       This causes the driver to:

              (1)  query the adapter about changes to the physical SCSI buses and/or fiber channel arbitrated loop, and

              (2)  make note of any new or removed sequential access devices or medium changers.

       The driver will output messages indicating which devices have been added or removed and the controller, bus, target, and lun
       used to address each device.  The driver then notifies the SCSI midlayer of these changes.

       Note that the naming convention of the /proc filesystem entries contains a number in addition  to  the  driver  name  (e.g.,
       "cciss0" instead of just "cciss", which you might expect).

       Note:  Only  sequential  access  devices and medium changers are presented as SCSI devices to the SCSI midlayer by the cciss
       driver.  Specifically, physical SCSI disk drives are not presented to the SCSI midlayer.  The only  disk  devices  that  are
       presented  to  the  kernel are logical drives that the array controller constructs from regions on the physical drives.  The
       logical drives are presented to the block layer (not to the SCSI midlayer).  It is important for the driver to  prevent  the
       kernel  from  accessing  the  physical drives directly, since these drives are used by the array controller to construct the
       logical drives.

   SCSI error handling for tape drives and medium changers
       The Linux SCSI midlayer provides an error-handling protocol that is initiated whenever a  SCSI  command  fails  to  complete
       within  a  certain amount of time (which can vary depending on the command).  The cciss driver participates in this protocol
       to some extent.  The normal protocol is a four-step process:

       (1)  First, the device is told to abort the command.

       (2)  If that doesn't work, the device is reset.

       (3)  If that doesn't work, the SCSI bus is reset.

       (4)  If that doesn't work, the host bus adapter is reset.

       The cciss driver is a block driver as well as a SCSI driver and only the tape drives and medium changers  are  presented  to
       the  SCSI midlayer.  Furthermore, unlike more straightforward SCSI drivers, disk I/O continues through the block side during
       the SCSI error-recovery process.  Therefore, the cciss driver implements only the first two of these actions,  aborting  the
       command,  and  resetting the device.  Note also that most tape drives will not oblige in aborting commands, and sometimes it
       appears they will not even obey a reset command, though in most circumstances they will.  If the command cannot  be  aborted
       and the device cannot be reset, the device will be set offline.

       In  the  event that the error-handling code is triggered and a tape drive is successfully reset or the tardy command is suc‐
       cessfully aborted, the tape drive may still not allow I/O to continue until some command is issued that positions  the  tape
       to  a known position.  Typically you must rewind the tape (by issuing mt -f /dev/st0 rewind for example) before I/O can pro‐
       ceed again to a tape drive that was reset.
