NAME
       amixer - command-line mixer for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       amixer [-option] [cmd]

DESCRIPTION
       amixer allows command-line control of the mixer for the ALSA soundcard driver.  amixer supports multiple soundcards.

       amixer with no arguments will display the current mixer settings for the default soundcard and device. This is a good way to
       see a list of the simple mixer controls you can use.

COMMANDS
       help   Shows syntax.

       info   Shows the information about a mixer device.

       scontrols
              Shows a complete list of simple mixer controls.

       scontents
              Shows a complete list of simple mixer controls with their contents.

       set or sset &lt;SCONTROL&gt; &lt;PARAMETER&gt; ...
              Sets the simple mixer control contents. The parameter can be the volume either as a percentage from 0% to 100% with %
              suffix,  a  dB  gain with dB suffix (like -12.5dB), or an exact hardware value.  The dB gain can be used only for the
              mixer elements with available dB information.  When plus(+) or minus(-) letter is appended after  volume  value,  the
              volume is incremented or decremented from the current value, respectively.

              The parameters cap, nocap, mute, unmute, toggle are used to change capture (recording) and muting for the group spec‐
              ified.

              The optional modifiers can be put as extra parameters before the value to specify the stream direction or channels to
              apply.  The modifiers playback and capture specify the stream, and the modifiers front, frontleft, frontright, front‐
              center, center, rear, rearright, rearleft, woofer are used to specify channels to be changed.

              A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one device can be controlled at a time.

       get or sget &lt;SCONTROL&gt;
              Shows the simple mixer control contents.

              A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one device can be controlled at a time.

       controls
              Shows a complete list of card controls.

       contents
              Shows a complete list of card controls with their contents.

       cset &lt;CONTROL&gt; &lt;PARAMETER&gt; ...
              Sets the card control contents. The identifier has these components: iface, name, index,  device,  subdevice,  numid.
              The next argument specifies the value of control.

       cget &lt;CONTROL&gt;
              Shows the card control contents. The identifier has same syntax as for the cset command.

ADVANCED COMMANDS
       sevents
              Shows the events for the simple mixer controls.

       events Shows the events for the mixer controls.

OPTIONS
       -c card

              Select the card number to control. The device name created from this parameter has syntax 'hw:N' where N is specified
              card number.

       -D device

              Select the device name to control. The default control name is 'default'.

       -s | --stdin

              Read from stdin and execute the command on each line sequentially.  When this option is given, the  command  in  com‐
              mand-line arguments is ignored.

              Only  sset and cset are accepted.  Other commands are ignored.  The commands to unmatched ids are ignored without er‐
              rors too.

       -h     Help: show syntax.

       -q     Quiet mode. Do not show results of changes.

       -R     Use the raw value for evaluating the percentage representation.  This is the default mode.

       -M     Use the mapped volume for evaluating the percentage representation like alsamixer, to be more natural for human ear.

EXAMPLES
       amixer -c 1 sset Line,0 80%,40% unmute cap
              will set the second soundcard's left line input volume to 80% and right line input to 40%, unmute it, and  select  it
              as a source for capture (recording).

       amixer -c 1 -- sset Master playback -20dB
              will set the master volume of the second card to -20dB.  If the master has multiple channels, all channels are set to
              the same value.

       amixer -c 1 set PCM 2dB+
              will increase the PCM volume of the second card with 2dB.  When both playback and capture volumes exist, this is  ap‐
              plied to both volumes.

       amixer -c 2 cset iface=MIXER,name='Line Playback Volume",index=1 40%
              will set the third soundcard's second line playback volume(s) to 40%

       amixer -c 2 cset numid=34 40%
              will set the 34th soundcard element to 40%
