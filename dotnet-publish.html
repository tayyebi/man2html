              dotnet publish -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       dotnet publish compiles the application, reads through its dependencies specified in the project file, and publishes the re‐
       sulting set of files to a directory.  The output includes the following assets:

       • Intermediate Language (IL) code in an assembly with a dll extension.

       • A .deps.json file that includes all of the dependencies of the project.

       • A .runtimeconfig.json file that specifies the shared runtime that the application expects, as well as other  configuration
         options for the runtime (for example, garbage collection type).

       • The application’s dependencies, which are copied from the NuGet cache into the output folder.

       The dotnet publish command’s output is ready for deployment to a hosting system (for example, a server, PC, Mac, laptop) for
       execution.  It’s the only officially supported way to prepare the application for deployment.  Depending on the type of  de‐
       ployment  that  the  project specifies, the hosting system may or may not have the .NET shared runtime installed on it.  For
       more information, see Publish .NET apps with the .NET CLI.

   Implicit restore
       You don’t have to run dotnet restore because it’s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to  occur,  such  as
       dotnet  new,  dotnet  build, dotnet run, dotnet test, dotnet publish, and dotnet pack.  To disable implicit restore, use the
       --no-restore option.

       The dotnet restore command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring makes sense, such  as  continuous
       integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicitly control when the restore occurs.

       For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the dotnet restore documentation.

   MSBuild
       The  dotnet  publish command calls MSBuild, which invokes the Publish target.  If the IsPublishable property is set to false
       for a particular project, the Publish target can’t be invoked, and the dotnet publish command only runs the implicit  dotnet
       restore on the project.

       Any  parameters passed to dotnet publish are passed to MSBuild.  The -c and -o parameters map to MSBuild’s Configuration and
       PublishDir properties, respectively.

       The dotnet publish command accepts MSBuild options, such as -p for setting properties and -l to define a logger.  For  exam‐
       ple, you can set an MSBuild property by using the format: -p:&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;.

       You can also set publish-related properties by referring to a .pubxml file.  For example:

              dotnet publish -p:PublishProfile=FolderProfile

       The  preceding  example  uses the FolderProfile.pubxml file that is found in the &lt;project_folder&gt;/Properties/PublishProfiles
       folder.  If you specify a path and file extension when setting the PublishProfile property, they are  ignored.   MSBuild  by
       default looks in the Properties/PublishProfiles folder and assumes the pubxml file extension.  To specify the path and file‐
       name including extension, set the PublishProfileFullPath property instead of the PublishProfile property.

       The following MSBuild properties change the output of dotnet publish.

       • PublishReadyToRun

         Compiles application assemblies as ReadyToRun (R2R) format.  R2R is a form of ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.   For  more
         information, see ReadyToRun images.

         To see warnings about missing dependencies that could cause runtime failures, use PublishReadyToRunShowWarnings=true.

         We recommend that you specify PublishReadyToRun in a publish profile rather than on the command line.

       • PublishSingleFile

         Packages  the app into a platform-specific single-file executable.  For more information about single-file publishing, see
         the single-file bundler design document (https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/single-file/design.md).

         We recommend that you specify this option in the project file rather than on the command line.

       • PublishTrimmed

         Trims unused libraries to reduce the deployment size of an app when publishing a self-contained executable.  For more  in‐
         formation, see Trim self-contained deployments and executables.  Available since .NET 6 SDK.

         We recommend that you specify this option in the project file rather than on the command line.

       For more information, see the following resources:

       • MSBuild command-line reference

       • Visual Studio publish profiles (.pubxml) for ASP.NET Core app deployment

       • dotnet msbuild

   Workload manifest downloads
       When  you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads.  If the
       download is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For more information, see Advertising  mani‐
       fests.

ARGUMENTS
       • PROJECT|SOLUTION

         The project or solution to publish.

         • PROJECT  is  the path and filename of a C#, F#, or Visual Basic project file, or the path to a directory that contains a
           C#, F#, or Visual Basic project file.  If the directory is not specified, it defaults to the current directory.

         • SOLUTION is the path and filename of a solution file (.sln extension), or the path to a directory that contains a  solu‐
           tion file.  If the directory is not specified, it defaults to the current directory.

OPTIONS
       • -a|--arch &lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;

         Specifies the target architecture.  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where the provid‐
         ed value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --arch x86 sets the RID to  win-
         x86.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.

       • -c|--configuration &lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;

         Defines  the  build  configuration.   The default for most projects is Debug, but you can override the build configuration
         settings in your project.

       • -f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;

         Publishes the application for the specified target framework.  You must specify the target framework in the project file.

       • --force

         Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful.  Specifying  this  flag  is  the  same  as
         deleting the project.assets.json file.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --interactive

         Allows  the  command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.  Available since
         .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • --manifest &lt;PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE&gt;

         Specifies one or several target manifests to use to trim the set of packages published with the app.  The manifest file is
         part of the output of the dotnet store command.  To specify multiple manifests, add a --manifest option for each manifest.

       • --no-build

         Doesn’t build the project before publishing.  It also implicitly sets the --no-restore flag.

       • --no-dependencies

         Ignores project-to-project references and only restores the root project.

       • --nologo

         Doesn’t display the startup banner or the copyright message.

       • --no-restore

         Doesn’t execute an implicit restore when running the command.

       • -o|--output &lt;OUTPUT_DIRECTORY&gt;

         Specifies the path for the output directory.

         If  not specified, it defaults to [project_file_folder]/bin/[configuration]/[framework]/publish/ for a framework-dependent
         executable  and  cross-platform  binaries.   It  defaults  to  [project_file_folder]/bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[run‐
         time]/publish/ for a self-contained executable.

         In  a web project, if the output folder is in the project folder, successive dotnet publish commands result in nested out‐
         put folders.  For example, if the project folder is myproject, and the publish output folder is myproject/publish, and you
         run  dotnet publish twice, the second run puts content files such as .config and .json files in myproject/publish/publish.
         To avoid nesting publish folders, specify a publish folder that is not directly under the project folder, or  exclude  the
         publish  folder from the project.  To exclude a publish folder named publishoutput, add the following element to a Proper‐
         tyGroup element in the .csproj file:

                &lt;DefaultItemExcludes&gt;$(DefaultItemExcludes);publishoutput**&lt;/DefaultItemExcludes&gt;

         • .NET Core 3.x SDK and later

           If you specify a relative path when publishing a project, the generated output directory  is  relative  to  the  current
           working directory, not to the project file location.

           If  you  specify  a relative path when publishing a solution, all output for all projects goes into the specified folder
           relative to the current working directory.  To make publish output go to separate folders for each  project,  specify  a
           relative  path  by  using  the  msbuild PublishDir property instead of the --output option.  For example, dotnet publish
           -p:PublishDir=.\publish sends publish output for each project to a publish folder under the  folder  that  contains  the
           project file.

         • .NET Core 2.x SDK

           If you specify a relative path when publishing a project, the generated output directory is relative to the project file
           location, not to the current working directory.

           If you specify a relative path when publishing a solution, each project’s output goes into a separate folder relative to
           the  project  file  location.   If  you  specify an absolute path when publishing a solution, all publish output for all
           projects goes into the specified folder.

       • --os &lt;OS&gt;

         Specifies the target operating system (OS).  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime  Identifier  (RID),  where
         the  provided  value  is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --os linux sets the
         RID to linux-x64.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6.

       • --sc|--self-contained [true|false]

         Publishes the .NET runtime with your application so the runtime doesn’t need to be installed on the target  machine.   De‐
         fault  is true if a runtime identifier is specified and the project is an executable project (not a library project).  For
         more information, see .NET application publishing and Publish .NET apps with the .NET CLI.

         If this option is used without specifying true or false, the default is true.  In that case, don’t  put  the  solution  or
         project argument immediately after --self-contained, because true or false is expected in that position.

       • --no-self-contained

         Equivalent to --self-contained false.

       • --source &lt;SOURCE&gt;

         The URI of the NuGet package source to use during the restore operation.

       • -r|--runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;

         Publishes  the  application for a given runtime.  For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog.  For more
         information, see .NET application publishing and Publish .NET apps with the .NET CLI.  If you use this option, use --self-
         contained or --no-self-contained also.

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets  the  verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
         The default is minimal.  For more information, see &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.LoggerVerbosity&gt;.

       • --use-current-runtime, --ucr [true|false]

         Sets the RuntimeIdentifier to a platform portable RuntimeIdentifier based on the one of your machine.   This  happens  im‐
         plicitly  with  properties that require a RuntimeIdentifier, such as SelfContained, PublishAot, PublishSelfContained, Pub‐
         lishSingleFile, and PublishReadyToRun.  If the property is set to false, that implicit resolution will no longer occur.

       • --version-suffix &lt;VERSION_SUFFIX&gt;

         Defines the version suffix to replace the asterisk (*) in the version field of the project file.

EXAMPLES
       • Create a framework-dependent cross-platform binary for the project in the current directory:

                dotnet publish

         Starting with .NET Core 3.0 SDK, this example also creates a framework-dependent executable for the current platform.

       • Create a self-contained executable for the project in the current directory, for a specific runtime:

                dotnet publish --runtime osx.10.11-x64

         The RID must be in the project file.

       • Create a framework-dependent executable for the project in the current directory, for a specific platform:

                dotnet publish --runtime osx.10.11-x64 --self-contained false

         The RID must be in the project file.  This example applies to .NET Core 3.0 SDK and later versions.

       • Publish the project in the current directory, for a specific runtime and target framework:

                dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp3.1 --runtime osx.10.11-x64

       • Publish the specified project file:

                dotnet publish ~/projects/app1/app1.csproj

       • Publish the current application but don’t restore project-to-project (P2P) references, just the root  project  during  the
         restore operation:

                dotnet publish --no-dependencies
