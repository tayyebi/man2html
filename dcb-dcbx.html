NAME
       dcb-dcbx - show / manipulate port DCBX (Data Center Bridging eXchange)

SYNOPSIS
       dcb [ OPTIONS ] dcbx { COMMAND | help }

       dcb dcbx show dev DEV

       dcb dcbx set dev DEV [ host ] [ lld-managed ] [ cee ] [ ieee ] [ static ]

DESCRIPTION
       Data Center Bridging eXchange (DCBX) is a protocol used by DCB devices to exchange configuration information with directly
       connected peers. The Linux DCBX object is a 1-byte bitfield of flags that configure whether DCBX is implemented in the de‐
       vice or in the host, and which version of the protocol should be used.  dcb dcbx is used to access the per-port Linux DCBX
       object.

       There are two principal modes of operation: in host mode, DCBX protocol is implemented by the host LLDP agent, and the DCB
       interfaces are used to propagate the negotiate parameters to capable devices. In lld-managed mode, the configuration is han‐
       dled by the device, and DCB interfaces are used for inspection of negotiated parameters, and can also be used to set initial
       parameters.

PARAMETERS
       When used with dcb dcbx set, the following keywords enable the corresponding configuration. The keywords that are not men‐
       tioned on the command line are considered disabled. When used with show, each enabled feature is shown by its corresponding
       keyword.

       host
       lld-managed
              The device is in the host mode of operation and, respectively, the lld-managed mode of operation, as described above.
              In principle these two keywords are mutually exclusive, but dcb dcbx allows setting both and lets the driver handle
              it as appropriate.

       cee
       ieee   The device supports CEE (Converged Enhanced Ethernet) and, respectively, IEEE version of the DCB specification. Typi‐
              cally only one of these will be set, but dcb dcbx does not mandate this.

       static indicates the engine supports static configuration. No actual negotiation is performed, negotiated parameters are al‐
              ways the initial configuration.

EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE
       Put the DCB engine into the "host" mode of operation, and use IEEE-standardized DCB interfaces:

       # dcb dcbx set dev eth0 host ieee

       Show what was set:

       # dcb dcbx show dev eth0
       host ieee

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer upon failure.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report any bugs to the Network Developers mailing list &lt;netdev@vger.kernel.org&gt; where the development and maintenance is
       primarily done.  You do not have to be subscribed to the list to send a message there.
