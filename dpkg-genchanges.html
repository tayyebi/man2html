NAME
       dpkg-genchanges - generate Debian .changes files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-genchanges [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-genchanges reads information from an unpacked and built Debian source tree and from the files it has generated and
       generates a Debian upload control file (.changes file).

OPTIONS
       --build=type
           Specifies the build type from a comma-separated list of components (since dpkg 1.18.5).

           The allowed values are:

           source
               Upload the source package.

           any Upload the architecture specific binary packages.

           all Upload the architecture independent binary packages.

           binary
               Upload the architecture specific and independent binary packages.  This is an alias for any,all.

           full
               Upload everything.  This is alias for source,any,all, and the same as the default case when no build option is
               specified.

       -g  Equivalent to --build=source,all (since dpkg 1.17.11).

       -G  Equivalent to --build=source,any (since dpkg 1.17.11).

       -b  Equivalent to --build=binary or --build=any,all.

       -B  Equivalent to --build=any.

       -A  Equivalent to --build=all.

       -S  Equivalent to --build=source.

       The -sx options control whether the original source archive is included in the upload if any source is being generated (i.e.
       -b or -B haven't been used).

       -si By default, or if specified, the original source will be included only if the upstream version number (the version
           without epoch and without Debian revision) differs from the upstream version number of the previous changelog entry.

       -sa Forces the inclusion of the original source.

       -sd Forces the exclusion of the original source and includes only the diff.

       -vversion
           Causes changelog information from all versions strictly later than version to be used.

       -Cchanges-description
           Read the description of the changes from the file changes-description rather than using the information from the source
           tree's changelog file.

       -mmaintainer-address
           Use maintainer-address as the name and email address of the maintainer for this package, rather than using the
           information from the source tree's control file.

       -emaintainer-address
           Use maintainer-address as the name and email address of the maintainer for this upload, rather than using the
           information from the source tree's changelog.

       -Vname=value
           Set an output substitution variable.  See deb-substvars(5) for a discussion of output substitution.

       -Tsubstvars-file
           Read substitution variables in substvars-file; the default is debian/substvars.  No variable substitution is done on any
           of the fields that are output, except for the contents extracted from each binary package Description field (since dpkg
           1.19.0), however the special variable Format will override the field of the same name.  This option can be used multiple
           times to read substitution variables from multiple files (since dpkg 1.15.6).

       -Dfield=value
           Override or add an output control file field.

       -Ufield
           Remove an output control file field.

       -ccontrolfile
           Specifies the main source control file to read information from. The default is debian/control.

       -lchangelog-file
           Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The default is debian/changelog.

       -ffiles-list-file
           Read the list of files to be uploaded here, rather than using debian/files.

       -Fchangelog-format
           Specifies the format of the changelog. See dpkg-parsechangelog(1) for information about alternative formats.

       -uupload-files-dir
           Look for the files to be uploaded in upload-files-dir rather than ..  (dpkg-genchanges needs to find these files so that
           it can include their sizes and checksums in the .changes file).

       -q  Usually dpkg-genchanges will produce informative messages on standard error, for example about how many of the package's
           source files are being uploaded.  -q suppresses these messages.

       -O[filename]
           Print the changes file to standard output (the default) or to filename if specified (since dpkg 1.18.5).

       -?, --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_COLORS
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.

       DPKG_NLS
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are: 0 and 1 (default).

FILES
       debian/files
           The list of generated files which are part of the upload being prepared.  dpkg-genchanges reads the data here when
           producing a .changes file.
