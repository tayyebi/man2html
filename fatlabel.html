<pre>FATLABEL(8)                                           System Manager's Manual                                           FATLABEL(8)

NAME
       fatlabel - set or get MS-DOS filesystem label or volume ID

SYNOPSIS
       fatlabel [OPTIONS] DEVICE [NEW]

DESCRIPTION
       fatlabel  will  display  or  change the volume label or volume ID on the MS-DOS filesystem located on DEVICE.  By default it
       works in label mode.  It can be switched to volume ID mode with the option -i or --volume-id.

       If NEW is omitted, then the existing label or volume ID is written to the standard output.  A label can't be longer than  11
       bytes  and should be in all upper case for best compatibility.  An empty string or a label consisting only of white space is
       not allowed.  A volume ID must be given as a hexadecimal number (no leading "0x" or similar) and must fit into 32 bits.

OPTIONS
       -i, --volume-id
           Switch to volume ID mode.

       -r, --reset
           Remove label in label mode or generate new ID in volume ID mode.

       -c PAGE, --codepage=PAGE
           Use DOS codepage PAGE to encode/decode label.  By default codepage 850 is used.

       -h, --help
           Display a help message and terminate.

       -V, --version
           Show version number and terminate.

COMPATIBILITY and BUGS
       For historic reasons FAT label is stored in two different locations: in the boot sector and as a special volume label  entry
       in  the  root  directory.   MS-DOS 5.00, MS-DOS 6.22, MS-DOS 7.10, Windows 98, Windows XP and also Windows 10 read FAT label
       only from the root directory.  Absence of the volume label in the root directory is interpreted as empty or none label, even
       if boot sector contains some valid label.

       When  Windows  XP or Windows 10 system changes a FAT label it stores it only in the root directory — letting boot sector un‐
       changed.  Which leads to problems when a label is removed on Windows.  Old label is still stored in the boot sector  but  is
       removed from the root directory.

       dosfslabel  prior to the version 3.0.7 operated only with FAT labels stored in the boot sector, completely ignoring a volume
       label in the root directory.

       dosfslabel in versions 3.0.7–3.0.15 reads FAT labels from the root directory and in case of absence, it fallbacks to a label
       stored  in the boot sector.  Change operation resulted in updating a label in the boot sector and sometimes also in the root
       directory due to the bug.  That bug was fixed in dosfslabel version 3.0.16 and since this version dosfslabel  updates  label
       in both location.

       Since  version 4.2, fatlabel reads a FAT label only from the root directory (like MS-DOS and Windows systems), but changes a
       FAT label in both locations.  In version 4.2 was fixed handling of empty labels and labels which starts with  a  byte  0xE5.
       Also in this version was added support for non-ASCII labels according to the specified DOS codepage and were added checks if
       a new label is valid.

       It is strongly suggested to not use dosfslabel prior to version 3.0.16.

DOS CODEPAGES
       MS-DOS and Windows systems use DOS (OEM) codepage for encoding and decoding FAT label.  In Windows systems DOS  codepage  is
       global  for  all running applications and cannot be configured explicitly.  It is set implicitly by option Language for non-
       Unicode programs available in Regional and Language Options via Control Panel.  Default DOS codepage for  fatlabel  is  850.
       See following mapping table between DOS codepage and Language for non-Unicode programs:
