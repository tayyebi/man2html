NAME
       nano - Nano's ANOther editor, inspired by Pico

SYNOPSIS
       nano [options] [[+line[,column]] file]...

       nano [options] [[+[crCR](/|?)string] file]...

DESCRIPTION
       nano is a small and friendly editor.  It copies the look and feel of Pico, but is free software, and implements several fea‐
       tures that Pico lacks, such as: opening multiple files, scrolling per line, undo/redo, syntax coloring, line numbering,  and
       soft-wrapping overlong lines.

       When  giving  a filename on the command line, the cursor can be put on a specific line by adding the line number with a plus
       sign (+) before the filename, and even in a specific column by adding it with a comma.  (Negative numbers count from the end
       of  the file or line.)  The cursor can be put on the first or last occurrence of a specific string by specifying that string
       after +/ or +? before the filename.  The string can be made case sensitive and/or caused to be interpreted as a regular  ex‐
       pression  by  inserting  c  and/or r after the + sign.  These search modes can be explicitly disabled by using the uppercase
       variant of those letters: C and/or R.  When the string contains spaces, it needs to be enclosed in quotes.  To give an exam‐
       ple: to open a file at the first occurrence of the word "Foo", you would do:

           nano +c/Foo file

       As a special case: if instead of a filename a dash (-) is given, nano will read data from standard input.

EDITING
       Entering  text and moving around in a file is straightforward: typing the letters and using the normal cursor movement keys.
       Commands are entered by using the Control (^) and the Alt or Meta (M-) keys.  Typing ^K deletes the current line and puts it
       in  the  cutbuffer.  Consecutive ^Ks will put all deleted lines together in the cutbuffer.  Any cursor movement or executing
       any other command will cause the next ^K to overwrite the cutbuffer.  A ^U will paste the current contents of the  cutbuffer
       at the current cursor position.

       When a more precise piece of text needs to be cut or copied, you can mark its start with ^6, move the cursor to its end (the
       marked text will be highlighted), and then use ^K to cut it, or M-6 to copy it to the cutbuffer.   You  can  also  save  the
       marked text to a file with ^O, or spell check it with ^T^T.

       On some terminals, text can be selected also by holding down Shift while using the arrow keys.  Holding down the Ctrl or Alt
       key too will increase the stride.  Any cursor movement without Shift being held will cancel such a selection.

       Any valid Unicode code point can be inserted into the buffer by typing M-V followed by the hexadecimal digits  of  the  code
       point  (concluded with &lt;Space&gt; or &lt;Enter&gt; when it are fewer than six digits).  A literal control code (except ^J) can be in‐
       serted by typing M-V followed by the pertinent keystroke.

       The two lines at the bottom of the screen show some important commands; the built-in help (^G) lists all the available ones.
       The default key bindings can be changed via a nanorc file -- see nanorc(5).

OPTIONS
       -A, --smarthome
              Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a
              line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the cursor is already at that  posi‐
              tion, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.

       -B, --backup
              When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the current filename suffixed with a tilde (~).

       -C directory, --backupdir=directory
              Make  and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved -- when
              backups are enabled (-B).  The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified directory.

       -D, --boldtext
              For the interface, use bold instead of reverse video.  This will be overridden by  setting  the  options  titlecolor,
              statuscolor, keycolor, functioncolor, numbercolor, and/or selectedcolor in your nanorc file.  See nanorc(5).

       -E, --tabstospaces
              Convert each typed tab to spaces -- to the number of spaces that a tab at that position would take up.

       -F, --multibuffer
              Read a file into a new buffer by default.

       -G, --locking
              Use vim-style file locking when editing files.

       -H, --historylog
              Save  the  last hundred search strings and replacement strings and executed commands, so they can be easily reused in
              later sessions.

       -I, --ignorercfiles
              Don't look at the system's nanorc nor at the user's nanorc.

       -J number, --guidestripe=number
              Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the width of the text.  (The color of  the  stripe  can  be
              changed with set stripecolor in your nanorc file.)

       -K, --rawsequences
              Interpret  escape  sequences  directly, instead of asking ncurses to translate them.  (If you need this option to get
              some keys to work properly, it means that the terminfo terminal description that is used does not fully match the ac‐
              tual  behavior  of  your terminal.  This can happen when you ssh into a BSD machine, for example.)  Using this option
              disables nano's mouse support.

       -L, --nonewlines
              Don't automatically add a newline when a text does not end with one.  (This can cause  you  to  save  non-POSIX  text
              files.)

       -M, --trimblanks
              Snip trailing whitespace from the wrapped line when automatic hard-wrapping occurs or when text is justified.

       -N, --noconvert
              Disable automatic conversion of files from DOS/Mac format.

       -O, --bookstyle
              When justifying, treat any line that starts with whitespace as the beginning of a paragraph (unless auto-indenting is
              on).

       -P, --positionlog
              For the 200 most recent files, log the last position of the cursor, and place it at that position again upon  reopen‐
              ing such a file.

       -Q "regex", --quotestr="regex"
              Set   the   regular   expression   for   matching   the   quoting   part   of   a   line.    The   default  value  is
              "^([ \t]*([!#%:;&gt;|}]|//))+".  (Note that \t stands for an actual Tab.)  This makes it possible to rejustify blocks of
              quoted text when composing email, and to rewrap blocks of line comments when writing source code.

       -R, --restricted
              Restricted  mode: don't read or write to any file not specified on the command line.  This means: don't read or write
              history files; don't allow suspending; don't allow spell checking; don't allow a file to be  appended  to,  prepended
              to,  or saved under a different name if it already has one; and don't make backup files.  Restricted mode can also be
              activated by invoking nano with any name beginning with 'r' (e.g. "rnano").

       -S, --softwrap
              Display over multiple screen rows lines that exceed the screen's width.  (You can make this  soft-wrapping  occur  at
              whitespace  instead  of rudely at the screen's edge, by using also --atblanks.)  (The old short option, -$, is depre‐
              cated.)

       -T number, --tabsize=number
              Set the size (width) of a tab to number columns.  The value of number must be greater than 0.  The default  value  is
              8.

       -U, --quickblank
              Make status-bar messages disappear after 1 keystroke instead of after 20.  Note that option -c (--constantshow) over‐
              rides this.  When option --minibar or --zero is in effect, --quickblank makes a message disappear after  0.8  seconds
              instead of after the default 1.5 seconds.

       -V, --version
              Show the current version number and exit.

       -W, --wordbounds
              Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation characters as part of a word.

       -X "characters", --wordchars="characters"
              Specify  which  other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric ones) should be considered as part of a word.  When
              using this option, you probably want to omit -W (--wordbounds).

       -Y name, --syntax=name
              Specify the name of the syntax highlighting to use from among the ones defined in the nanorc files.

       -Z, --zap
              Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region (instead of a single character, and  without  affecting
              the cutbuffer).

       -a, --atblanks
              When doing soft line wrapping, wrap lines at whitespace instead of always at the edge of the screen.

       -b, --breaklonglines
              Automatically  hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong.  (This option is the opposite of -w (--nowrap) --
              the last one given takes effect.)

       -c, --constantshow
              Constantly show the cursor position on the status bar.  Note that this overrides option -U (--quickblank).

       -d, --rebinddelete
              Interpret the Delete and Backspace keys differently so that both Backspace and Delete work properly.  You should only
              use this option when on your system either Backspace acts like Delete or Delete acts like Backspace.

       -e, --emptyline
              Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.

       -f file, --rcfile=file
              Read only this file for setting nano's options, instead of reading both the system-wide and the user's nanorc files.

       -g, --showcursor
              Make  the cursor visible in the file browser (putting it on the highlighted item) and in the help viewer.  Useful for
              braille users and people with poor vision.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of the available command-line options and exit.

       -i, --autoindent
              Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or spaces as the previous line  (or  as  the
              next line if the previous line is the beginning of a paragraph).

       -j, --jumpyscrolling
              Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.

       -k, --cutfromcursor
              Make  the  'Cut  Text'  command (normally ^K) cut from the current cursor position to the end of the line, instead of
              cutting the entire line.

       -l, --linenumbers
              Display line numbers to the left of the text area.  (Any line with an anchor additionally gets a mark in the margin.)

       -m, --mouse
              Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled, mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor,  set
              the  mark  (with a double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X Window System, and on the con‐
              sole when gpm is running.  Text can still be selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.

       -n, --noread
              Treat any name given on the command line as a new file.  This allows nano to write to named pipes: it will start with
              a blank buffer, and will write to the pipe when the user saves the "file".  This way nano can be used as an editor in
              combination with for instance gpg without having to write sensitive data to disk first.

       -o directory, --operatingdir=directory
              Set the operating directory.  This makes nano set up something similar to a chroot.

       -p, --preserve
              Preserve the XON and XOFF sequences (^Q and ^S) so they will be caught by the terminal.

       -q, --indicator
              Display a "scrollbar" on the righthand side of the edit window.  It shows the position of the viewport in the  buffer
              and how much of the buffer is covered by the viewport.

       -r number, --fill=number
              Set  the  target  width  for  justifying and automatic hard-wrapping at this number of columns.  If the value is 0 or
              less, wrapping will occur at the width of the screen minus number columns, allowing the wrap point to vary along with
              the width of the screen if the screen is resized.  The default value is -8.

       -s "program [argument ...]", --speller="program [argument ...]"
              Use  this  command  to perform spell checking and correcting, instead of using the built-in corrector that calls hun‐
              spell(1) or spell(1).

       -t, --saveonexit
              Save a changed buffer without prompting (when exiting with ^X).

       -u, --unix
              Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano's default behavior of saving a file in the format that it
              had.  (This option has no effect when you also use --noconvert.)

       -v, --view
              Just  view  the  file  and  disallow editing: read-only mode.  This mode allows the user to open also other files for
              viewing, unless --restricted is given too.

       -w, --nowrap
              Do not automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong.  This is the default.  (This option is  the
              opposite of -b (--breaklonglines) -- the last one given takes effect.)

       -x, --nohelp
              Don't show the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.

       -y, --afterends
              Make Ctrl+Right and Ctrl+Delete stop at word ends instead of beginnings.

       -!, --magic
              When neither the file's name nor its first line give a clue, try using libmagic to determine the applicable syntax.

       -%, --stateflags
              Use  the top-right corner of the screen for showing some state flags: I when auto-indenting, M when the mark is on, L
              when hard-wrapping (breaking long lines), R when recording a macro, and S when soft-wrapping.   When  the  buffer  is
              modified, a star (*) is shown after the filename in the center of the title bar.

       -_, --minibar
              Suppress  the  title  bar  and  instead show information about the current buffer at the bottom of the screen, in the
              space for the status bar.  In this "minibar" the filename is shown on the left, followed by an asterisk if the buffer
              has  been  modified.   On the right are displayed the current line and column number, the code of the character under
              the cursor (in Unicode format: U+xxxx), the same flags as are shown by --stateflags, and a percentage that  expresses
              how far the cursor is into the file (linewise).  When a file is loaded or saved, and also when switching between buf‐
              fers, the number of lines in the buffer is displayed after the filename.  This number is cleared upon the  next  key‐
              stroke, or replaced with an [i/n] counter when multiple buffers are open.  The line plus column numbers and the char‐
              acter code are displayed only when --constantshow is used, and can be toggled on and off with M-C.  The  state  flags
              are displayed only when --stateflags is used.

       -0, --zero
              Hide all elements of the interface (title bar, status bar, and help lines) and use all rows of the terminal for show‐
              ing the contents of the buffer.  The status bar appears only when there is a significant message, and disappears  af‐
              ter  1.5  seconds  or  upon the next keystroke.  With M-Z the title bar plus status bar can be toggled.  With M-X the
              help lines.

TOGGLES
       Several of the above options can be switched on and off also while nano is running.  For example, M-L toggles the hard-wrap‐
       ping  of  long  lines, M-S toggles soft-wrapping, M-N toggles line numbers, M-M toggles the mouse, M-I auto-indentation, and
       M-X the help lines.  See at the end of the ^G help text for a complete list.

       The M-X toggle is special: it works in all menus except the help viewer and the linter.  All other toggles work in the  main
       menu only.

FILES
       When --rcfile is given, nano will read just the specified file for setting its options and syntaxes and key bindings.  With‐
       out that option, nano will read two configuration files: first the system's nanorc (if  it  exists),  and  then  the  user's
       nanorc  (if  it exists), either ~/.nanorc or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nano/nanorc or ~/.config/nano/nanorc, whichever is encountered
       first.  See nanorc(5) for more information on the possible contents of those files.

       See /usr/share/nano/ and /usr/share/nano/extra/ for available syntax-coloring definitions.

NOTES
       Option -z (--suspendable) has been removed.  Suspension is enabled by default, reachable via ^T^Z.  (If you want a plain  ^Z
       to suspend nano, add bind ^Z suspend main to your nanorc.)

       If no alternative spell checker command is specified on the command line nor in one of the nanorc files, nano will check the
       SPELL environment variable for one.

       In some cases nano will try to dump the buffer into an emergency file.  This will happen mainly if nano receives a SIGHUP or
       SIGTERM  or  runs  out of memory.  It will write the buffer into a file named nano.save if the buffer didn't have a name al‐
       ready, or will add a ".save" suffix to the current filename.  If an emergency file with that name already exists in the cur‐
       rent  directory,  it will add ".save" plus a number (e.g. ".save.1") to the current filename in order to make it unique.  In
       multibuffer mode, nano will write all the open buffers to their respective emergency files.

BUGS
       The recording and playback of keyboard macros works correctly only on a terminal emulator, not on a Linux console (VT),  be‐
       cause the latter does not by default distinguish modified from unmodified arrow keys.

       Please report any other bugs that you encounter via:
       https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano.

       When  nano  crashes, it will save any modified buffers to emergency .save files.  If you are able to reproduce the crash and
       you want to get a backtrace, define the environment variable NANO_NOCATCH.
