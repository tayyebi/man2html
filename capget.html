<pre>capget(2)                                               System Calls Manual                                               capget(2)

NAME
       capget, capset - set/get capabilities of thread(s)

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/capability.h&gt; /* Definition of CAP_* and
                                        _LINUX_CAPABILITY_* constants */
       #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;      /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int syscall(SYS_capget, cap_user_header_t hdrp,
                   cap_user_data_t datap);
       int syscall(SYS_capset, cap_user_header_t hdrp,
                   const cap_user_data_t datap);

       Note: glibc provides no wrappers for these system calls, necessitating the use of syscall(2).

DESCRIPTION
       These  two system calls are the raw kernel interface for getting and setting thread capabilities.  Not only are these system
       calls specific to Linux, but the kernel API is likely to change and use of these system calls (in particular the  format  of
       the cap_user_*_t types) is subject to extension with each kernel revision, but old programs will keep working.

       The  portable  interfaces  are cap_set_proc(3) and cap_get_proc(3); if possible, you should use those interfaces in applica‐
       tions; see NOTES.

   Current details
       Now that you have been warned, some current kernel details.  The structures are defined as follows.

           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_1  0x19980330
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_1     1

                   /* V2 added in Linux 2.6.25; deprecated */
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_2  0x20071026
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_2     2

                   /* V3 added in Linux 2.6.26 */
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3  0x20080522
           #define _LINUX_CAPABILITY_U32S_3     2

           typedef struct __user_cap_header_struct {
              __u32 version;
              int pid;
           } *cap_user_header_t;

           typedef struct __user_cap_data_struct {
              __u32 effective;
              __u32 permitted;
              __u32 inheritable;
           } *cap_user_data_t;

       The effective, permitted, and inheritable fields are bit masks of the capabilities defined in  capabilities(7).   Note  that
       the  CAP_* values are bit indexes and need to be bit-shifted before ORing into the bit fields.  To define the structures for
       passing to the system call, you have to use the struct __user_cap_header_struct and struct __user_cap_data_struct names  be‐
       cause the typedefs are only pointers.

       Kernels  prior  to  Linux  2.6.25  prefer  32-bit capabilities with version _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_1.  Linux 2.6.25 added
       64-bit capability sets, with version _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_2.  There was, however, an API glitch, and Linux 2.6.26 added
       _LINUX_CAPABILITY_VERSION_3 to fix the problem.

       Note that 64-bit capabilities use datap[0] and datap[1], whereas 32-bit capabilities use only datap[0].

       On  kernels that support file capabilities (VFS capabilities support), these system calls behave slightly differently.  This
       support was added as an option in Linux 2.6.24, and became fixed (nonoptional) in Linux 2.6.33.

       For capget() calls, one can probe the capabilities of any process by specifying its process  ID  with  the  hdrp-&gt;pid  field
       value.

       For details on the data, see capabilities(7).

   With VFS capabilities support
       VFS  capabilities employ a file extended attribute (see xattr(7)) to allow capabilities to be attached to executables.  This
       privilege model obsoletes kernel support for one process asynchronously setting the capabilities of another.   That  is,  on
       kernels that have VFS capabilities support, when calling capset(), the only permitted values for hdrp-&gt;pid are 0 or, equiva‐
       lently, the value returned by gettid(2).

   Without VFS capabilities support
       On older kernels that do not provide VFS capabilities support capset() can, if the caller has the CAP_SETPCAP capability, be
       used to change not only the caller's own capabilities, but also the capabilities of other threads.  The call operates on the
       capabilities of the thread specified by the pid field of hdrp when that is nonzero, or on the capabilities  of  the  calling
       thread  if pid is 0.  If pid refers to a single-threaded process, then pid can be specified as a traditional process ID; op‐
       erating on a thread of a multithreaded process requires a thread ID of the type returned by gettid(2).   For  capset(),  pid
       can  also be: -1, meaning perform the change on all threads except the caller and init(1); or a value less than -1, in which
       case the change is applied to all members of the process group whose ID is -pid.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

       The calls fail with the error EINVAL, and set the version field of hdrp to the kernel  preferred  value  of  _LINUX_CAPABIL‐
       ITY_VERSION_?   when an unsupported version value is specified.  In this way, one can probe what the current preferred capa‐
       bility revision is.

ERRORS
       EFAULT Bad memory address.  hdrp must not be NULL.  datap may be NULL only when the user is trying  to  determine  the  pre‐
              ferred capability version format supported by the kernel.

       EINVAL One of the arguments was invalid.

       EPERM  An attempt was made to add a capability to the permitted set, or to set a capability in the effective set that is not
              in the permitted set.

       EPERM  An attempt was made to add a capability to the inheritable set, and either:

              •  that capability was not in the caller's bounding set; or

              •  the capability was not in the caller's permitted set and the caller lacked the CAP_SETPCAP capability in  its  ef‐
                 fective set.

       EPERM  The  caller attempted to use capset() to modify the capabilities of a thread other than itself, but lacked sufficient
              privilege.  For kernels supporting VFS capabilities, this is never permitted.  For kernels lacking VFS  support,  the
              CAP_SETPCAP  capability is required.  (A bug in kernels before Linux 2.6.11 meant that this error could also occur if
              a thread without this capability tried to change its own capabilities by specifying the pid field as a nonzero  value
              (i.e., the value returned by getpid(2)) instead of 0.)

       ESRCH  No such thread.

STANDARDS
       These system calls are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       The  portable  interface to the capability querying and setting functions is provided by the libcap library and is available
