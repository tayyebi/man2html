NAME
       apgbfm - APG Bloom filter management program

SYNOPSIS
       apgbfm -f filter -n numofwords [-q] [-s]
       apgbfm -f filter -d dictfile [-q] [-s]
       apgbfm -f filter -a word [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -A dictfile [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -c word [-q]
       apgbfm -f filter -C dictfile [-q]
       apgbfm -i filter
       apgbfm [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       apgbfm is used to manage Bloom filter that is used to restrict password generation in APG pasword generation software. Usage
       of the Bloom filter allows to speed up password check for large dictionaries and has some other benefits.

       The idea to use Bloom filter for that purpose is came from the description of the OPUS project OPUS: Preventing  Weak  Pass‐
       word Choices Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR 92-028 writen by Eugene H. Spafford.

       You can obtain this article from:
       http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/tech-reps/9128.ps
       It has very nice description of Bloom filter and it's advantages for password checking systems.

       In simple words, apgbfm generates n hash values for every word and sets corresponding bits in filter file to 1. To check the
       word apgbfm generates the same hash functions for that word and if all n corresponding bits in filter file are set to 1 then
       it suppose that word exists in dicionary.  apgbfm uses SHA-1 as a hash function.

       apgbfm can be used as standalone utility, not only with apg, or apgd.

       WARNING !!!
              Filter  file  format  can  be  changed in the future. I'll try to make file formats compatible but i can not guaranty
              this.

       WARNING !!!
              apgbfm may slow down your computer during filter creation.

OPTIONS
       -f filter
              use filter as the name for Bloom filter filename.

       -i filter
              print information about filter.

       -n numofwords
              create new empty filter for numofwords number of words. Useful when you want to fill filter dynamicaly.

       -d dictfile
              create new filter from dictfile. It may take a lot of time to generate filter from a big dictionary. In that  dictio‐
              nary  you may place words (one per line) that should not appear as generated passwords.  For example: user names com‐
              mon words, etc. You even can use one of the dictionaries that come with dictionary password crackers.  This check  is
              case  sensitive.  For  example,  if  you want to reject word 'root', you should insert in dictfile words: root, Root,
              RoOt, ... , ROOT.  To indicate that program is working apgbfm prints dot for every 100 words added in dictionary.

       -a word
              add word to the filter.

       -A dictfile
              add all words from dictfile to the filter. To indicate that program is working apgbfm prints dot for every 100  words
              added in dictionary.

       -c word
              check word for appearance in the filter.

       -C dictfile
              check every word from dictfile for appearance in the filter.

       -q     quiet mode.

       -s     create new filter in case-insensitive mode.

       -v     print version information.

       -h     print help information.

EXIT CODE
       On  successful  completion  of  its  task, apgbfm will complete with exit code 0.  An exit code of -1 indicates an error oc‐
       curred.  Textual errors are written to the standard error stream.

FILES
       None.

BUGS
       None.  If you've found one, please send bug description to the author.

       This man page is Alpha too.
