NAME
       e2fsck.conf - Configuration file for e2fsck

DESCRIPTION
       e2fsck.conf  is  the  configuration  file for e2fsck(8).  It controls the default behavior of e2fsck(8) while it is checking
       ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.

       The e2fsck.conf file uses an INI-style format.  Stanzas, or top-level sections, are delimited by square braces: [ ].  Within
       each  section,  each line defines a relation, which assigns tags to values, or to a subsection, which contains further rela‐
       tions or subsections.  An example of the INI-style format used by this configuration file follows below:

            [section1]
                 tag1 = value_a
                 tag1 = value_b
                 tag2 = value_c

            [section 2]
                 tag3 = {
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_a
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_b
                      subtag2 = subtag_value_c
                 }
                 tag1 = value_d
                 tag2 = value_e
            }

       Comments are delimited by a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') character at the beginning of the comment, and are terminated by
       the end of line character.

       Tags  and  values must be quoted using double quotes if they contain spaces.  Within a quoted string, the standard backslash
       interpretations apply: "\n" (for the newline character), "\t" (for the tab character), "\b" (for the  backspace  character),
       and "\\" (for the backslash character).

       The  following  stanzas  are used in the e2fsck.conf file.  They will be described in more detail in future sections of this
       document.

       [options]
              This stanza contains general configuration parameters for e2fsck's behavior.

       [defaults]
              Contains relations which define the default parameters used by e2fsck(8).  In general, these defaults may be overrid‐
              den by command-line options provided by the user.

       [problems]
              This stanza allows the administrator to reconfigure how e2fsck handles various file system inconsistencies.

       [scratch_files]
              This stanza controls when e2fsck will attempt to use scratch files to reduce the need for memory.

THE [options] STANZA
       The following relations are defined in the [options] stanza.

       allow_cancellation
              If  this relation is set to a boolean value of true, then if the user interrupts e2fsck using ^C, and the file system
              is not explicitly flagged as containing errors, e2fsck will exit with an exit status of 0 instead of 32.   This  set‐
              ting defaults to false.

       accept_time_fudge
              Unfortunately, due to Windows' unfortunate design decision to configure the hardware clock to tick localtime, instead
              of the more proper and less error-prone UTC time, many users end up in the situation where the system clock is incor‐
              rectly set at the time when e2fsck is run.

              Historically  this was usually due to some distributions having buggy init scripts and/or installers that didn't cor‐
              rectly detect this case and take appropriate countermeasures.  Unfortunately, this is occasionally true  even  today,
              usually  due  to a buggy or misconfigured virtualization manager or the installer not having access to a network time
              server during the installation process.  So by default, we allow the superblock times to be fudged by up to 24 hours.
              This can be disabled by setting accept_time_fudge to the boolean value of false.  This setting defaults to true.

       broken_system_clock
              The  e2fsck(8)  program  has  some heuristics that assume that the system clock is correct.  In addition, many system
              programs make similar assumptions.  For example, the UUID library depends on time not going backwards in order for it
              to  be  able  to  make  its guarantees about issuing universally unique ID's.  Systems with broken system clocks, are
              well, broken.  However, broken system clocks, particularly in embedded systems, do exist.  E2fsck will attempt to use
              heuristics to determine if the time can not be trusted; and to skip time-based checks if this is true.  If this bool‐
              ean is set to true, then e2fsck will always assume that the system clock can not be trusted.

       buggy_init_scripts
              This boolean relation is an alias for accept_time_fudge for backwards compatibility; it used to be that the  behavior
              defined  by  accept_time_fudge above defaulted to false, and buggy_init_scripts would enable superblock time field to
              be wrong by up to 24 hours.  When we changed the default, we also renamed this boolean relation to accept_time_fudge.

       clear_test_fs_flag
              This boolean relation controls whether or not e2fsck(8) will offer to clear the test_fs flag if the ext4 file  system
              is available on the system.  It defaults to true.

       defer_check_on_battery
              This boolean relation controls whether or not the interval between file system checks (either based on time or number
              of mounts) should be doubled if the system is running on battery.  This setting defaults to true.

       indexed_dir_slack_percentage
              When e2fsck(8) repacks a indexed directory, reserve the specified percentage of empty space in  each  leaf  nodes  so
              that  a few new entries can be added to the directory without splitting leaf nodes, so that the average fill ratio of
              directories can be maintained at a higher, more efficient level.  This relation defaults to 20 percent.

       inode_count_fullmap
              If this boolean relation is true, trade off using memory for speed when checking a file system with a large number of
              hard-linked  files.   The  amount of memory required is proportional to the number of inodes in the file system.  For
              large file systems, this can be gigabytes of memory.  (For example a 40TB file system with 2.8  billion  inodes  will
              consume an additional 5.7 GB memory if this optimization is enabled.)  This setting defaults to false.

       log_dir
              If  the log_filename or problem_log_filename relations contains a relative pathname, then the log file will be placed
              in the directory named by the log_dir relation.

       log_dir_fallback
              This relation contains an alternate directory that will be used if the directory specified by log_dir is  not  avail‐
              able or is not writable.

       log_dir_wait
              If  this boolean relation is true, them if the directories specified by log_dir or log_dir_fallback are not available
              or are not yet writable, e2fsck will save the output in a memory buffer, and a child process will  periodically  test
              to  see  if  the log directory has become available after the boot sequence has mounted the requested file system for
              reading/writing.  This implements the functionality provided by logsave(8) for e2fsck log files.

       log_filename
              This relation specifies the file name where a copy of e2fsck's output will be written.   If certain  problem  reports
              are  suppressed  using the max_count_problems relation, (or on a per-problem basis using the max_count relation), the
              full set of problem reports will be written to the log file.  The filename may  contain  various  percent-expressions
              (%D,  %T, %N, etc.) which will be expanded so that the file name for the log file can include things like date, time,
              device name, and other run-time parameters.  See the LOGGING section for more details.

       max_count_problems
              This relation specifies the maximum number of problem reports of a particular type will be printed to  stdout  before
              further  problem reports of that type are squelched.  This can be useful if the console is slow (i.e., connected to a
              serial port) and so a large amount of output could end up delaying the boot process  for  a  long  time  (potentially
              hours).

       no_optimize_extents
              If  this  boolean  relation  is true, do not offer to optimize the extent tree by reducing the tree's width or depth.
              This setting defaults to false.

       problem_log_filename
              This relation specifies the file name where a log of problem codes found by e2fsck be written.  The filename may con‐
              tain various percent-expressions (%D, %T, %N, etc.) which will be expanded so that the file name for the log file can
              include things like date, time, device name, and other run-time parameters.  See the LOGGING  section  for  more  de‐
              tails.

       readahead_mem_pct
              Use  this percentage of memory to try to read in metadata blocks ahead of the main e2fsck thread.  This should reduce
              run times, depending on the speed of the underlying storage and the amount of free memory.  There is no default,  but
              see readahead_kb for more details.

       readahead_kb
              Use  this  amount of memory to read in metadata blocks ahead of the main checking thread.  Setting this value to zero
              disables readahead entirely.  By default, this is set the size of two block groups' inode tables (typically 4MiB on a
              regular ext4 file system); if this amount is more than 1/50th of total physical memory, readahead is disabled.

       report_features
              If  this boolean relation is true, e2fsck will print the file system features as part of its verbose reporting (i.e.,
              if the -v option is specified)

       report_time
              If this boolean relation is true, e2fsck will run as if the options -tt are always specified.  This will cause e2fsck
              to print timing statistics on a pass by pass basis for full file system checks.

       report_verbose
              If this boolean relation is true, e2fsck will run as if the option -v is always specified.  This will cause e2fsck to
              print some additional information at the end of each full file system check.

THE [defaults] STANZA
       The following relations are defined in the [defaults] stanza.

       undo_dir
              This relation specifies the directory where  the  undo  file  should  be  stored.   It  can  be  overridden  via  the
              E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR  environment variable.  If the directory location is set to the value none, e2fsck will not create
              an undo file.

THE [problems] STANZA
       Each tag in the [problems] stanza names a problem code specified with a leading "0x" followed by six hex digits.  The  value
       of  the tag is a subsection where the relations in that subsection override the default treatment of that particular problem
       code.

       Note that inappropriate settings in this stanza may cause e2fsck to behave incorrectly, or even crash.  Most system adminis‐
       trators should not be making changes to this section without referring to source code.

       Within each problem code's subsection, the following tags may be used:

       description
              This relation allows the message which is printed when this file system inconsistency is detected to be overridden.

       preen_ok
              This boolean relation overrides the default behavior controlling whether this file system problem should be automati‐
              cally fixed when e2fsck is running in preen mode.

       max_count
              This integer relation overrides the max_count_problems parameter (set in the options  section)  for  this  particular
              problem.

       no_ok  This boolean relation overrides the default behavior determining whether or not the file system will be marked as in‐
              consistent if the user declines to fix the reported problem.

       no_default
              This boolean relation overrides whether the default answer for this problem (or question) should be "no".

       preen_nomessage
              This boolean relation overrides the default behavior controlling whether or not the description for this file  system
              problem should be suppressed when e2fsck is running in preen mode.

       no_nomsg
              This  boolean relation overrides the default behavior controlling whether or not the description for this file system
              problem should be suppressed when a problem forced not to be fixed, either because e2fsck is run with the  -n  option
              or because the force_no flag has been set for the problem.

       force_no
              This  boolean option, if set to true, forces a problem to never be fixed.  That is, it will be as if the user problem
              responds 'no' to the question of 'should this problem be fixed?'.  The force_no option even overrides the  -y  option
              given on the command-line (just for the specific problem, of course).

       not_a_fix
              This  boolean  option,  it  set  to true, marks the problem as one where if the user gives permission to make the re‐
              quested change, it does not mean that the file system had a problem which has since been fixed.  This is used for re‐
              quests to optimize the file system's data structure, such as pruning an extent tree.

THE [scratch_files] STANZA
       The following relations are defined in the [scratch_files] stanza.

       directory
              If  the  directory  named by this relation exists and is writeable, then e2fsck will attempt to use this directory to
              store scratch files instead of using in-memory data structures.

       numdirs_threshold
              If this relation is set, then in-memory data structures will be used if the number of directories in the file  system
              are fewer than amount specified.

       dirinfo
              This  relation  controls whether or not the scratch file directory is used instead of an in-memory data structure for
              directory information.  It defaults to true.

       icount This relation controls whether or not the scratch file directory is used instead of an in-memory data structure  when
              tracking inode counts.  It defaults to true.

LOGGING
       E2fsck  has the facility to save the information from an e2fsck run in a directory so that a system administrator can review
       its output at their leisure.  This allows information captured during the automatic e2fsck preen run, as well as a  manually
       started  e2fsck run, to be saved for posterity.  This facility is controlled by the log_filename, log_dir, log_dir_fallback,
       and log_dir_wait relations in the [options] stanza.

       The filename in log_filename may contain the following percent-expressions that will be expanded as follows.

       %d     The current day of the month

       %D     The current date; this is a equivalent of %Y%m%d

       %h     The hostname of the system.

       %H     The current hour in 24-hour format (00..23)

       %m     The current month as a two-digit number (01..12)

       %M     The current minute (00..59)

       %N     The name of the block device containing the file system, with any directory pathname stripped off.

       %p     The pid of the e2fsck process

       %s     The current time expressed as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC

       %S     The current second (00..59)

       %T     The current time; this is equivalent of %H%M%S

       %u     The name of the user running e2fsck.

       %U     This percent expression does not expand to anything, but it signals that  any  following  date  or  time  expressions
              should be expressed in UTC time instead of the local timezone.

       %y     The last two digits of the current year (00..99)

       %Y     The current year (i.e., 2012).

EXAMPLES
       The  following  recipe will prevent e2fsck from aborting during the boot process when a file system contains orphaned files.
       (Of course, this is not always a good idea, since critical files that are needed for the security of the system could poten‐
       tially  end  up  in  lost+found, and starting the system without first having a system administrator check things out may be
       dangerous.)

            [problems]
                 0x040002 = {
                      preen_ok = true
                      description = "@u @i %i.  "
                 }

       The following recipe will cause an e2fsck logfile to be written to the directory /var/log/e2fsck, with a filename that  con‐
       tains  the device name, the hostname of the system, the date, and time: e.g., "e2fsck-sda3.server.INFO.20120314-112142".  If
       the directory containing /var/log is located on the root file system which is initially mounted read-only, then  the  output
       will  be saved in memory and written out once the root file system has been remounted read/write.   To avoid too much detail
       from being written to the serial console (which could potentially slow down the boot sequence), only print no more  than  16
       instances of each type of file system corruption.
