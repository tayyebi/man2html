              dotnet build -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       The dotnet build command builds the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries.  The binaries include the project’s
       code in Intermediate Language (IL) files with a .dll extension.  Depending on the project type and settings, other files may
       be included, such as:

       • An  executable  that  can  be used to run the application, if the project type is an executable targeting .NET Core 3.0 or
         later.

       • Symbol files used for debugging with a .pdb extension.

       • A .deps.json file, which lists the dependencies of the application or library.

       • A .runtimeconfig.json file, which specifies the shared runtime and its version for an application.

       • Other libraries that the project depends on (via project references or NuGet package references).

       For executable projects targeting versions earlier than .NET Core 3.0, library dependencies from  NuGet  are  typically  NOT
       copied  to  the  output folder.  They’re resolved from the NuGet global packages folder at run time.  With that in mind, the
       product of dotnet build isn’t ready to be transferred to another machine to run.  To create a  version  of  the  application
       that can be deployed, you need to publish it (for example, with the dotnet publish command).  For more information, see .NET
       Application Deployment.

       For executable projects targeting .NET Core 3.0 and later, library dependencies are copied to the output folder.  This means
       that if there isn’t any other publish-specific logic (such as Web projects have), the build output should be deployable.

   Implicit restore
       Building  requires the project.assets.json file, which lists the dependencies of your application.  The file is created when
       dotnet restore is executed.  Without the assets file in place, the tooling can’t resolve reference assemblies, which results
       in errors.

       You  don’t  have  to run dotnet restore because it’s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to occur, such as
       dotnet new, dotnet build, dotnet run, dotnet test, dotnet publish, and dotnet pack.  To disable implicit  restore,  use  the
       --no-restore option.

       The  dotnet  restore command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring makes sense, such as continuous
       integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicitly control when the restore occurs.

       For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the dotnet restore documentation.

       This command supports the dotnet restore options when passed in the long form (for example, --source).  Short form  options,
       such as -s, are not supported.

   Executable or library output
       Whether  the project is executable or not is determined by the &lt;OutputType&gt; property in the project file.  The following ex‐
       ample shows a project that produces executable code:

              &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
                &lt;OutputType&gt;Exe&lt;/OutputType&gt;
              &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

       To produce a library, omit the &lt;OutputType&gt; property or change its value to Library.  The IL DLL for a library doesn’t  con‐
       tain entry points and can’t be executed.

   MSBuild
       dotnet  build uses MSBuild to build the project, so it supports both parallel and incremental builds.  For more information,
       see Incremental Builds.

       In addition to its options, the dotnet build command accepts MSBuild options, such as -p for setting properties or -l to de‐
       fine  a  logger.  For more information about these options, see the MSBuild Command-Line Reference.  Or you can also use the
       dotnet msbuild command.

              When dotnet build is run automatically by dotnet run, arguments like -property:property=value aren’t respected.

       Running dotnet build is equivalent to running dotnet msbuild -restore; however, the default verbosity of the output is  dif‐
       ferent.

   Workload manifest downloads
       When  you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads.  If the
       download is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For more information, see Advertising  mani‐
       fests.

ARGUMENTS
       PROJECT | SOLUTION

       The  project or solution file to build.  If a project or solution file isn’t specified, MSBuild searches the current working
       directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in either proj or sln and uses that file.

OPTIONS
       • -a|--arch &lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;

         Specifies the target architecture.  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where the provid‐
         ed  value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --arch x86 sets the RID to win-
         x86.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.

       • -c|--configuration &lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;

         Defines the build configuration.  The default for most projects is Debug, but you can  override  the  build  configuration
         settings in your project.

       • -f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;

         Compiles for a specific framework.  The framework must be defined in the project file.  Examples: net7.0, net462.

       • --force

         Forces  all  dependencies  to  be  resolved  even if the last restore was successful.  Specifying this flag is the same as
         deleting the project.assets.json file.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --interactive

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.   Available  since
         .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • --no-dependencies

         Ignores project-to-project (P2P) references and only builds the specified root project.

       • --no-incremental

         Marks  the  build as unsafe for incremental build.  This flag turns off incremental compilation and forces a clean rebuild
         of the project’s dependency graph.

       • --no-restore

         Doesn’t execute an implicit restore during build.

       • --nologo

         Doesn’t display the startup banner or the copyright message.

       • --no-self-contained

         Publishes the application as a framework dependent application.  A compatible .NET runtime must be installed on the target
         machine to run the application.  Available since .NET 6 SDK.

       • -o|--output &lt;OUTPUT_DIRECTORY&gt;

         Directory in which to place the built binaries.  If not specified, the default path is ./bin/&lt;configuration&gt;/&lt;framework&gt;/.
         For projects with multiple target frameworks (via the TargetFrameworks property), you also need to define --framework when
         you specify this option.

       • --os &lt;OS&gt;

         Specifies  the  target  operating system (OS).  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where
         the provided value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --os  linux  sets  the
         RID to linux-x64.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6.

       • -r|--runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;

         Specifies the target runtime.  For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog.  If you use this option with
         .NET 6 SDK, use --self-contained or --no-self-contained also.  If not specified, the default is to build for  the  current
         OS and architecture.

       • --self-contained [true|false]

         Publishes  the  .NET  runtime with the application so the runtime doesn’t need to be installed on the target machine.  The
         default is true if a runtime identifier is specified.  Available since .NET 6 SDK.

       • --source &lt;SOURCE&gt;

         The URI of the NuGet package source to use during the restore operation.

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets the verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed],  and  diag[nostic].
         The default is minimal.  For more information, see &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.LoggerVerbosity&gt;.

       • --use-current-runtime, --ucr [true|false]

         Sets  the  RuntimeIdentifier  to a platform portable RuntimeIdentifier based on the one of your machine.  This happens im‐
         plicitly with properties that require a RuntimeIdentifier, such as SelfContained, PublishAot,  PublishSelfContained,  Pub‐
         lishSingleFile, and PublishReadyToRun.  If the property is set to false, that implicit resolution will no longer occur.

       • --version-suffix &lt;VERSION_SUFFIX&gt;

         Sets the value of the $(VersionSuffix) property to use when building the project.  This only works if the $(Version) prop‐
         erty isn’t set.  Then, $(Version) is set to the $(VersionPrefix) combined with the $(VersionSuffix), separated by a dash.

EXAMPLES
       • Build a project and its dependencies:

                dotnet build

       • Build a project and its dependencies using Release configuration:

                dotnet build --configuration Release

       • Build a project and its dependencies for a specific runtime (in this example, Ubuntu 18.04):

                dotnet build --runtime ubuntu.18.04-x64

       • Build the project and use the specified NuGet package source during the restore operation:

                dotnet build --source c:\packages\mypackages

       • Build the project and set version 1.2.3.4 as a build parameter using the -p MSBuild option:

                dotnet build -p:Version=1.2.3.4
