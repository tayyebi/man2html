NAME
       apt_preferences - Preference control file for APT

DESCRIPTION
       The APT preferences file /etc/apt/preferences and the fragment files in the /etc/apt/preferences.d/ folder can be used to
       control which versions of packages will be selected for installation.

       Several versions of a package may be available for installation when the sources.list(5) file contains references to more
       than one distribution (for example, stable and testing). APT assigns a priority to each version that is available. Subject
       to dependency constraints, apt-get selects the version with the highest priority for installation. The APT preferences
       override the priorities that APT assigns to package versions by default, thus giving the user control over which one is
       selected for installation.

       Several instances of the same version of a package may be available when the sources.list(5) file contains references to
       more than one source. In this case apt-get downloads the instance listed earliest in the sources.list(5) file. The APT
       preferences do not affect the choice of instance, only the choice of version.

       Preferences are a strong power in the hands of a system administrator but they can become also their biggest nightmare if
       used without care! APT will not question the preferences, so wrong settings can lead to uninstallable packages or wrong
       decisions while upgrading packages. Even more problems will arise if multiple distribution releases are mixed without a good
       understanding of the following paragraphs. Packages included in a specific release aren't tested in (and therefore don't
       always work as expected in) older or newer releases, or together with other packages from different releases. You have been
       warned.

       Note that the files in the /etc/apt/preferences.d directory are parsed in alphanumeric ascending order and need to obey the
       following naming convention: The files have either no or "pref" as filename extension and only contain alphanumeric, hyphen
       (-), underscore (_) and period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored a file, unless that
       file matches a pattern in the Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in which case it will be silently ignored.

   APT's Default Priority Assignments
       If there is no preferences file or if there is no entry in the file that applies to a particular version then the priority
       assigned to that version is the priority of the distribution to which that version belongs. It is possible to single out a
       distribution, "the target release", which receives a higher priority than other distributions do by default. The target
       release can be set on the apt-get command line or in the APT configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf. Note that this has
       precedence over any general priority you set in the /etc/apt/preferences file described later, but not over specifically
       pinned packages. For example,

           apt-get install -t testing some-package

           APT::Default-Release "stable";

       If the target release has been specified then APT uses the following algorithm to set the priorities of the versions of a
       package. Assign:

       priority 1
           to the versions coming from archives which in their Release files are marked as "NotAutomatic: yes" but not as
           "ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes" like the Debian experimental archive, as well as versions that are not phased on this
           systems.

       priority 100
           to the version that is already installed (if any) and to the versions coming from archives which in their Release files
           are marked as "NotAutomatic: yes" and "ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes" like the Debian backports archive since
           squeeze-backports.

       priority 500
           to the versions that do not belong to the target release.

       priority 990
           to the versions that belong to the target release.
       The highest of those priorities whose description matches the version is assigned to the version.

       If the target release has not been specified then APT simply assigns priority 100 to all installed package versions and
       priority 500 to all uninstalled package versions, except versions coming from archives which in their Release files are
       marked as "NotAutomatic: yes" - these versions get the priority 1 or priority 100 if it is additionally marked as
       "ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes".

       APT then applies the following rules, listed in order of precedence, to determine which version of a package to install.

       •   Never downgrade unless the priority of an available version exceeds 1000. ("Downgrading" is installing a less recent
           version of a package in place of a more recent version. Note that none of APT's default priorities exceeds 1000; such
           high priorities can only be set in the preferences file. Note also that downgrading a package can be risky.)

       •   Install the highest priority version.

       •   If two or more versions have the same priority, install the most recent one (that is, the one with the higher version
           number).

       •   If two or more versions have the same priority and version number but either the packages differ in some of their
           metadata or the --reinstall option is given, install the uninstalled one.

       In a typical situation, the installed version of a package (priority 100) is not as recent as one of the versions available
       from the sources listed in the sources.list(5) file (priority 500 or 990). Then the package will be upgraded when apt-get
       install some-package or apt-get upgrade is executed.

       More rarely, the installed version of a package is more recent than any of the other available versions. The package will
       not be downgraded when apt-get install some-package or apt-get upgrade is executed.

       Sometimes the installed version of a package is more recent than the version belonging to the target release, but not as
       recent as a version belonging to some other distribution. Such a package will indeed be upgraded when apt-get install
       some-package or apt-get upgrade is executed, because at least one of the available versions has a higher priority than the
       installed version.

   Phased Updates
       APT understands a field called Phased-Update-Percentage which can be used to control the rollout of a new version. It is an
       integer between 0 and 100.

       A system's eligibility to a phased update is determined by seeding random number generator with the package source name, the
       version number, and /etc/machine-id, and then calculating an integer in the range [0, 100]. If this integer is larger than
       the Phased-Update-Percentage, the version is pinned to 1, and thus held back. Otherwise, normal policy rules apply.

       In case you have multiple systems that you want to receive the same set of updates, you can set APT::Machine-ID to a UUID
       such that they all phase the same, or set APT::Get::Never-Include-Phased-Updates or APT::Get::Always-Include-Phased-Updates
       to true such that APT will never/always consider phased updates.

   The Effect of APT Preferences
       The APT preferences file allows the system administrator to control the assignment of priorities. The file consists of one
       or more multi-line records separated by blank lines. Records can have one of two forms, a specific form and a general form.

       •   The specific form assigns a priority (a "Pin-Priority") to one or more specified packages with a specified version or
           version range. For example, the following record assigns a high priority to all versions of the perl package whose
           version number begins with "5.32". Multiple packages can be separated by spaces.

               Package: perl
               Pin: version 5.32*
               Pin-Priority: 1001

       •   The general form assigns a priority to all of the package versions in a given distribution (that is, to all the versions
           of packages that are listed in a certain Release file) or to all of the package versions coming from a particular
           Internet site, as identified by the site's fully qualified domain name.

           This general-form entry in the APT preferences file applies only to groups of packages. For example, the following
           record assigns a high priority to all package versions available from the local site.

               Package: *
               Pin: origin ""
               Pin-Priority: 999

           A note of caution: the keyword used here is "origin" which can be used to match a hostname. The following record will
           assign a high priority to all versions available from the server identified by the hostname "ftp.de.debian.org"

               Package: *
               Pin: origin "ftp.de.debian.org"
               Pin-Priority: 999

           This should not be confused with the Origin of a distribution as specified in a Release file. What follows the "Origin:"
           tag in a Release file is not an Internet address but an author or vendor name, such as "Debian" or "Ximian".

           The following record assigns a low priority to all package versions belonging to any distribution whose Archive name is
           "unstable".

               Package: *
               Pin: release a=unstable
               Pin-Priority: 50

           The following record assigns a high priority to all package versions belonging to any distribution whose Codename is
           "trixie".

               Package: *
               Pin: release n=trixie
               Pin-Priority: 900

           The following record assigns a high priority to all package versions belonging to any release whose Archive name is
           "stable" and whose release Version number is "12".

               Package: *
               Pin: release a=stable, v=12
               Pin-Priority: 500

       The effect of the comma operator is similar to an "and" in logic: All conditions must be satisfied for the pin to match.
       There is one exception: For any type of condition (such as two "a" conditions), only the last such condition is checked.

   Matching packages in the Package field
       The Package field specifies the package that a pinning priority is applied to. The field can either contain a binary package
       name, a source package name (prefixed with "src:"), a glob(7) expression or a regular expression (surrounded by slashes).
       Multiple package names, glob(7) expressions and regular expressions can be listed separated by whitespace in which case the
       record will match any of the matched packages.

       By default, only packages of the native architecture are matched. To match binary packages of any architecture, add the :any
       suffix to the package name. You can also limit matching to a specific architecture by appending the architecture name to the
       package name, separated by a colon character.

       For example, the following example uses a glob expression and a regular expression to assign the priority 500 to all
       packages from experimental where the name starts with gnome (as a glob(7)-like expression) or contains the word kde (as a
       POSIX extended regular expression surrounded by slashes).

           Package: gnome* /kde/
           Pin: release a=experimental
           Pin-Priority: 500

       The rule for those expressions is that they can occur anywhere where a string can occur. Thus, the following pin assigns the
       priority 990 to all packages from a release starting with lunar.

           Package: *
           Pin: release n=lunar*
           Pin-Priority: 990

       If a regular expression occurs in a Package field, the behavior is the same as if this regular expression were replaced with
       a list of all package names it matches. It is undecided whether this will change in the future; thus you should always list
       wild-card pins first, so later specific pins override it. The pattern "*" in a Package field is not considered a glob(7)
       expression in itself.

       To pin all binaries produced by the apt source package of this APT's version to 990, you can do:

           Package: src:apt
           Pin: version 2.6.0ubuntu0.1
           Pin-Priority: 990

       Source package pinning can be combined with regular expressions and glob patterns, and can also take a binary architecture.

       For example, let's pin all binaries for all architectures produced by any source package containing apt in its name to 990:

           Package: src:*apt*:any
           Pin: version *
           Pin-Priority: 990

       The :any suffix makes sure to select binary packages from any architecture. Without that suffix, apt implicitly assumes the
       :native suffix which would only select packages from the native architecture.

   How APT Interprets Priorities
       Priorities (P) assigned in the APT preferences file must be positive or negative integers. They are interpreted as follows
       (roughly speaking):

       P &gt;= 1000
           causes a version to be installed even if this constitutes a downgrade of the package

       990 &lt;= P &lt; 1000
           causes a version to be installed even if it does not come from the target release, unless the installed version is more
           recent

       500 &lt;= P &lt; 990
           causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available belonging to the target release or the installed
           version is more recent

       100 &lt;= P &lt; 500
           causes a version to be installed unless there is a version available belonging to some other distribution or the
           installed version is more recent

       0 &lt; P &lt; 100
           causes a version to be installed only if there is no installed version of the package

       P &lt; 0
           prevents the version from being installed

       P = 0
           has undefined behaviour, do not use it.

       The first specific-form record matching an available package version determines the priority of the package version. Failing
       that, the priority of the package is defined as the maximum of all priorities defined by generic-form records matching the
       version. Records defined using patterns in the Pin field other than "*" are treated like specific-form records.

       For example, suppose the APT preferences file contains the three records presented earlier:

           Package: perl
           Pin: version 5.32*
           Pin-Priority: 1001

           Package: *
           Pin: origin ""
           Pin-Priority: 999

           Package: *
           Pin: release unstable
           Pin-Priority: 50

       Then:

       •   The most recent available version of the perl package will be installed, so long as that version's version number begins
           with "5.32". If any 5.32* version of perl is available and the installed version is 5.36*, then perl will be downgraded.

       •   A version of any package other than perl that is available from the local system has priority over other versions, even
           versions belonging to the target release.

       •   A version of a package whose origin is not the local system but some other site listed in sources.list(5) and which
           belongs to an unstable distribution is only installed if it is selected for installation and no version of the package
           is already installed.

   Determination of Package Version and Distribution Properties
       The locations listed in the sources.list(5) file should provide Packages and Release files to describe the packages
       available at that location.

       The Packages file is normally found in the directory .../dists/dist-name/component/arch: for example,
       .../dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages. It consists of a series of multi-line records, one for each package available in
       that directory. Only two lines in each record are relevant for setting APT priorities:

       the Package: line
           gives the package name

       the Version: line
           gives the version number for the named package

       The Release file is normally found in the directory .../dists/dist-name: for example, .../dists/stable/Release, or
       .../dists/bookworm/Release. It consists of a single multi-line record which applies to all of the packages in the directory
       tree below its parent. Unlike the Packages file, nearly all of the lines in a Release file are relevant for setting APT
       priorities:

       the Archive: or Suite: line
           names the archive to which all the packages in the directory tree belong. For example, the line "Archive: stable" or
           "Suite: stable" specifies that all of the packages in the directory tree below the parent of the Release file are in a
           stable archive. Specifying this value in the APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release a=stable

       the Codename: line
           names the codename to which all the packages in the directory tree belong. For example, the line "Codename: trixie"
           specifies that all of the packages in the directory tree below the parent of the Release file belong to a version named
           trixie. Specifying this value in the APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release n=trixie

       the Version: line
           names the release version. For example, the packages in the tree might belong to Debian release version 12. Note that
           there is normally no version number for the testing and unstable distributions because they have not been released yet.
           Specifying this in the APT preferences file would require one of the following lines.

               Pin: release v=12
               Pin: release a=stable, v=12
               Pin: release 12

       the Component: line
           names the licensing component associated with the packages in the directory tree of the Release file. For example, the
           line "Component: main" specifies that all the packages in the directory tree are from the main component, which entails
           that they are licensed under terms listed in the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Specifying this component in the APT
           preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release c=main

       the Origin: line
           names the originator of the packages in the directory tree of the Release file. Most commonly, this is Debian.
           Specifying this origin in the APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release o=Debian

       the Label: line
           names the label of the packages in the directory tree of the Release file. Most commonly, this is Debian. Specifying
           this label in the APT preferences file would require the line:

               Pin: release l=Debian

       All of the Packages and Release files retrieved from locations listed in the sources.list(5) file are stored in the
       directory /var/lib/apt/lists, or in the file named by the variable Dir::State::Lists in the apt.conf file. For example, the
       file debian.lcs.mit.edu_debian_dists_unstable_contrib_binary-i386_Release contains the Release file retrieved from the site
       debian.lcs.mit.edu for binary-i386 architecture files from the contrib component of the unstable distribution.

   Optional Lines in an APT Preferences Record
       Each record in the APT preferences file can optionally begin with one or more lines beginning with the word Explanation:.
       This provides a place for comments.

EXAMPLES
   Tracking Stable
       The following APT preferences file will cause APT to assign a priority higher than the default (500) to all package versions
       belonging to a stable distribution and a prohibitively low priority to package versions belonging to other Debian
       distributions.

           Explanation: Uninstall or do not install any Debian-originated
           Explanation: package versions other than those in the stable distro
           Package: *
           Pin: release a=stable
           Pin-Priority: 900

           Package: *
           Pin: release o=Debian
           Pin-Priority: -10

       With a suitable sources.list(5) file and the above preferences file, any of the following commands will cause APT to upgrade
       to the latest stable version(s).

           apt-get install package-name
           apt-get upgrade
           apt-get dist-upgrade

       The following command will cause APT to upgrade the specified package to the latest version from the testing distribution;
       the package will not be upgraded again unless this command is given again.

           apt-get install package/testing

   Tracking Testing or Unstable
       The following APT preferences file will cause APT to assign a high priority to package versions from the testing
       distribution, a lower priority to package versions from the unstable distribution, and a prohibitively low priority to
       package versions from other Debian distributions.

           Package: *
           Pin: release a=testing
           Pin-Priority: 900

           Package: *
           Pin: release a=unstable
           Pin-Priority: 800

           Package: *
           Pin: release o=Debian
           Pin-Priority: -10

       With a suitable sources.list(5) file and the above preferences file, any of the following commands will cause APT to upgrade
       to the latest testing version(s).

           apt-get install package-name
           apt-get upgrade
           apt-get dist-upgrade

       The following command will cause APT to upgrade the specified package to the latest version from the unstable distribution.
       Thereafter, apt-get upgrade will upgrade the package to the most recent testing version if that is more recent than the
       installed version, otherwise, to the most recent unstable version if that is more recent than the installed version.

           apt-get install package/unstable

   Tracking the evolution of a codename release
       The following APT preferences file will cause APT to assign a priority higher than the default (500) to all package versions
       belonging to a specified codename of a distribution and a prohibitively low priority to package versions belonging to other
       Debian distributions, codenames and archives. Note that with this APT preference APT will follow the migration of a release
       from the archive testing to stable and later oldstable. If you want to follow for example the progress in testing
       notwithstanding the codename changes you should use the example configurations above.

           Explanation: Uninstall or do not install any Debian-originated package versions
           Explanation: other than those in the distribution codenamed with trixie or sid
           Package: *
           Pin: release n=trixie
           Pin-Priority: 900

           Explanation: Debian unstable is always codenamed with sid
           Package: *
           Pin: release n=sid
