NAME
       e2scrub_all - check all mounted ext[234] file systems for errors.

SYNOPSIS
       e2scrub_all [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Searches the system for all LVM logical volumes containing an ext2, ext3, or ext4 file system, and checks them for problems.
       The checking is performed by invoking the e2scrub tool, which will look for  corruptions.   Corrupt  file  systems  will  be
       tagged  as  having  errors so that fsck will be invoked before the next mount.  If no errors are encountered, fstrim will be
       called on the file system if it is mounted.  See the e2scrub manual page for more information about how the checking is per‐
       formed.

OPTIONS
       -n     Print what commands e2scrub_all would execute to initiate the e2scrub operations.  (Note: these commands will not ac‐
              tually be executed; however, since e2scrub_all needs to run some additional, privileged commands to query the  system
              to determine which e2scrub commands would be executed, it still needs to be run as root.)

       -r     Remove e2scrub snapshots but do not check anything.

       -A     Scrub all ext[234] file systems even if they are not mounted.

       -V     Print version information and exit.
