NAME
       cups - a standards-based, open source printing system

DESCRIPTION
       CUPS  is  the  software  you  use  to  print  from  applications like word processors, email readers, photo editors, and web
       browsers. It converts the page descriptions produced by your application (put a paragraph here, draw a line  there,  and  so
       forth) into something your printer can understand and then sends the information to the printer for printing.

       Now, since every printer manufacturer does things differently, printing can be very complicated.  CUPS does its best to hide
       this from you and your application so that you can concentrate on printing and less on how to  print.  Generally,  the  only
       time you need to know anything about your printer is when you use it for the first time, and even then CUPS can often figure
       things out on its own.

   HOW DOES IT WORK?
       The first time you print to a printer, CUPS creates a queue to keep track of the current status of the  printer  (everything
       OK, out of paper, etc.) and any pages you have printed. Most of the time the queue points to a printer connected directly to
       your computer via a USB port, however it can also point to a printer on your network, a printer on the Internet, or multiple
       printers  depending  on  the configuration. Regardless of where the queue points, it will look like any other printer to you
       and your applications.

       Every time you print something, CUPS creates a job which contains the queue you are sending the print to, the  name  of  the
       document  you  are printing, and the page descriptions. Job are numbered (queue-1, queue-2, and so forth) so you can monitor
       the job as it is printed or cancel it if you see a mistake. When CUPS gets a job for printing, it determines the  best  pro‐
       grams  (filters,  printer  drivers,  port monitors, and backends) to convert the pages into a printable format and then runs
       them to actually print the job.

       When the print job is completely printed, CUPS removes the job from the queue and moves on to any other jobs you  have  sub‐
       mitted.  You can also be notified when the job is finished, or if there are any errors during printing, in several different
       ways.

   WHERE DO I BEGIN?
       The easiest way to start is by using the web interface to configure your printer. Go to  "http://localhost:631"  and  choose
       the Administration tab at the top of the page. Click/press on the Add Printer button and follow the prompts.

       When you are asked for a username and password, enter your login username and password or the "root" username and password.

       After  the  printer  is  added  you will be asked to set the default printer options (paper size, output mode, etc.) for the
       printer. Make any changes as needed and then click/press on the Set Default Options button to save them. Some printers  also
       support  auto-configuration  -  click/press  on the Query Printer for Default Options button to update the options automati‐
       cally.

       Once you have added the printer, you can print to it from any application. You can also choose  Print  Test  Page  from  the
       maintenance menu to print a simple test page and verify that everything is working properly.

       You can also use the lpadmin(8) and lpinfo(8) commands to add printers to CUPS.  Additionally, your operating system may in‐
       clude graphical user interfaces or automatically create printer queues when you connect a printer to your computer.

   HOW DO I GET HELP?
       The OpenPrinting CUPS web site (https://openprinting.github.io/cups) provides access to  the  cups  and  cups-devel  mailing
       lists, additional documentation and resources, and a bug report database. Most vendors also provide online discussion forums
       to ask printing questions for your operating system of choice.

ENVIRONMENT
       CUPS commands use the following environment variables to override the default locations of files and so forth. For  security
       reasons, these environment variables are ignored for setuid programs:

       CUPS_ANYROOT
            Whether to allow any X.509 certificate root (Y or N).

       CUPS_CACHEDIR
            The directory where semi-persistent cache files can be found.

       CUPS_DATADIR
            The directory where data files can be found.

       CUPS_ENCRYPTION
            The default level of encryption (Always, IfRequested, Never, Required).

       CUPS_EXPIREDCERTS
            Whether to allow expired X.509 certificates (Y or N).

       CUPS_GSSSERVICENAME
            The Kerberos service name used for authentication.

       CUPS_SERVER
            The hostname/IP address and port number of the CUPS scheduler (hostname:port or ipaddress:port).

       CUPS_SERVERBIN
            The directory where server helper programs, filters, backend, etc. can be found.

       CUPS_SERVERROOT
            The root directory of the server.

       CUPS_STATEDIR
            The directory where state files can be found.

       CUPS_USER
            Specifies the name of the user for print requests.

       HOME Specifies the home directory of the current user.

       IPP_PORT
            Specifies the default port number for IPP requests.

       LOCALEDIR
            Specifies the location of localization files.

       LPDEST
            Specifies the default print queue (System V standard).

       PRINTER
            Specifies the default print queue (Berkeley standard).

       TMPDIR
            Specifies the location of temporary files.

FILES
       ~/.cups/client.conf
       ~/.cups/lpoptions

CONFORMING TO
       CUPS conforms to the Internet Printing Protocol version 2.1 and implements the Berkeley and System V UNIX print commands.

NOTES
       CUPS  printer drivers, backends, and PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future feature release of
       CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
