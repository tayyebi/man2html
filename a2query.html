NAME
       a2query - retrieve runtime configuration from a local Apache 2 HTTP server

SYNOPSIS
       a2query  [-m [MODULE]] [-s [SITE]] [-c [CONF]] [-a] [-v] [-M] [-d] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       a2query is a program designed to retrieve configuration values from a locally available Apache 2 HTTP web server. It was
       designed to be as robust as possible by returning feasible values even if the Apache 2 syntax validator fails.

       This program is primarily meant to be used from maintainer scripts.

OPTIONS
       -a  Returns the Apache 2 "Module Magic Version" (API version) number, the server was compiled with. The returned version
           does not contain any minor versions which are known to be compatible with the major version returned.

       -c [CONF]
           Checks whether the configuration CONF is enabled. If no argument was given, all enabled configuration files are being
           returned. CONF is compared by string comparison by ignoring a leading "mod_" prefix and possibly a '.conf' or '.load'
           suffix.

       -h  Displays a brief summary how the program can be called and exits.

       -m [MODULE]
           Checks whether the module MODULE is enabled, The argument is interpreted in the same way, as for configuration files
           queried by the -c switch.

       -M  Returns the currently enabled Apache 2 MPM (Multi Processing Module).

       -s [SITE]
           Checks whether the module SITE is enabled, The argument is interpreted in the same way, as for configuration files
           queried by the -c switch.

       -v  returns the currently installed Apache 2 HTTP server version

       -q  suppress any output. This is useful to invoke a2query from another script. This is useful if only the return code is of
           interest.

EXIT CODES
       a2query returns with a zero (0) exit status if the requested operation was effectuated successfully and with a non-zero
       status otherwise. In case of an error it leaves with error code 32 if a requested module, site or configuration was not
       found and 33 if a module, site or configuration was disabled by a maintainer script. However, exit status 1 is returned if
       the module was not found at all
