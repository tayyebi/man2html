NAME
       HTML::FormatRTF - Format HTML as RTF

VERSION
       version 2.16

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::FormatRTF;

         my $out_file = "test.rtf";
         open(RTF, "&gt;$out_file")
          or die "Can't write-open $out_file: $!\nAborting";

         print RTF HTML::FormatRTF-&gt;format_file(
           'test.html',
             'fontname_headings' =&gt; "Verdana",
         );
         close(RTF);

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::FormatRTF is a class for objects that you use to convert HTML to RTF.  There is currently no proper support for tables
       or forms.

       This is a subclass of HTML::Formatter, whose documentation you should consult for more information on underlying methods
       such as "new", "format", "format_file" etc

       You can specify any of the following parameters in the call to "new", "format_file", or "format_string":

       lm  Amount of extra indenting to apply to the left margin, in twips (twentieths of a point). Default is 0.

           So if you wanted the left margin to be an additional half inch larger, you'd set "lm =&gt; 720" (since there's 1440 twips
           in an inch). If you wanted it to be about 1.5cm larger, you'd set "lw =&gt; 850" (since there's about 567 twips in a
           centimeter).

       rm  Amount of extra indenting to apply to the left margin, in twips (twentieths of a point).  Default is 0.

       normal_halfpoint_size
           This is the size of normal text in the document, in half-points. The default value is 22, meaning that normal text is in
           11 point.

       header_halfpoint_size
           This is the size of text used in the document's page-header, in half-points.  The default value is 17, meaning that
           normal text is in 7.5 point.  Currently, the header consists just of "p. pagenumber" in the upper-right-hand corner, and
           cannot be disabled.

       head1_halfpoint_size ... head6_halfpoint_size
           These control the font size of each heading level, in half-twips.  For example, the default for head3_halfpoint_size is
           25, meaning that HTML "&lt;h3&gt;...&lt;/h3&gt;" text will be in 12.5 point text (in addition to being underlined and in the heading
           font).

       codeblock_halfpoint_size
           This controls the font size (in half-points) of the text used for "&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;" text.  By default, it is 18, meaning
           9 point.

       fontname_body
           This option controls what font is to be used for the body of the text -- that is, everything other than heading text and
           text in pre/code/tt elements. The default value is currently "Times".  Other handy values I can suggest using are
           "Georgia" or "Bookman Old Style".

       fontname_code
           This option controls what font is to be used for text in pre/code/tt elements.  The default value is currently "Courier
           New".

       fontname_headings
           This option controls what font name is to be used for headings.  You can use the same font as fontname_body, but I
           prefer a sans-serif font, so the default value is currently "Arial".  Also consider "Tahoma" and "Verdana".

       document_language
           This option controls what Microsoft language number will be specified as the language for this document. The current
           default value is 1033, for US English.  Consult an RTF reference for other language numbers.

       hr_width
           This option controls how many underline characters will be used for rendering a "&lt;hr&gt;" tag. Its default value is
           currently 50. You can usually leave this alone, but under some circumstances you might want to use a smaller or larger
           number.

       no_prolog
           If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatRTF will make a point of not emitting the RTF prolog before the
           document.  By default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatRTF will emit the prolog.  This option is of interest only
           to advanced users.

       no_trailer
           If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatRTF will make a point of not emitting the RTF trailer at the end of
           the document.  By default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatRTF will emit the bit of RTF that ends the document.
           This option is of interest only to advanced users.
