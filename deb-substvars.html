NAME
       deb-substvars - Debian source substitution variables

SYNOPSIS
       debian/substvars, debian/binary-package.substvars, variables

DESCRIPTION
       Before dpkg-source, dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-genchanges write their control information (to the source control file .dsc for
       dpkg-source and to standard output for dpkg-gencontrol and dpkg-genchanges) they perform some variable substitutions on the
       output file.

   Variable Syntax
       A variable substitution has the form ${variable-name}.  Variable names consist of alphanumerics (a-zA-Z0-9), hyphens (-) and
       colons (:) and start with an alphanumeric, and are case-sensitive, even though they might refer to other entities which are
       case-preserving.  Variable substitutions are performed repeatedly until none are left; the full text of the field after the
       substitution is rescanned to look for more substitutions.

   File Syntax
       Substitution variables can be specified in a file.  These files consist of lines of the form name=value or name?=value.  The
       = operator assigns a normal substitution variable, while the ?= operator (since dpkg 1.21.8) assigns an optional
       substitution variable which will emit no warnings even if unused.  Trailing whitespace on each line, blank lines, and lines
       starting with a # symbol (comments) are ignored.

   Substitution
       Variables can be set using the -V common option.  They can be also specified in the file debian/substvars (or whatever other
       file is specified using the -T common option).

       After all the substitutions have been done each occurrence of the string ${} (which is not an actual substitution variable)
       is replaced with a $ sign.  This can be used as an escape sequence such as ${}{VARIABLE} which will end up as ${VARIABLE} on
       the output.

       If a variable is referred to but not defined it generates a warning and an empty value is assumed.

       While variable substitution is done on all control fields, some of those fields are used and needed during the build when
       the substitution did not yet occur. That's why you can't use variables in the Package, Source and Architecture fields.

       Variable substitution happens on the content of the fields after they have been parsed, thus if you want a variable to
       expand over multiple lines you do not have to include a space after the newline. This is done implicitly when the field is
       output. For example, if the variable ${Description} is set to "foo is bar.${Newline}foo is great." and if you have the
       following field:

        Description: foo application
         ${Description}
         .
         More text.

       It will result in:

        Description: foo application
         foo is bar.
         foo is great.
         .
         More text.

   Built-in Variable
       Additionally, the following standard variables are always available:

       Arch
           The current host architecture (i.e. the architecture the package is being built for, the equivalent of DEB_HOST_ARCH).

       vendor:Name
           The current vendor name (since dpkg 1.20.0).  This value comes from the Vendor field for the current vendor's origin
           file, as dpkg-vendor(1) would retrieve it.

       vendor:Id
           The current vendor ID (since dpkg 1.20.0).  This is just the lowercase variant of vendor:Name.

       source:Version
           The source package version (since dpkg 1.13.19).

       source:Upstream-Version
           The upstream source package version, including the Debian version epoch if any (since dpkg 1.13.19).

       binary:Version
           The binary package version (which may differ from source:Version in a binNMU for example; since dpkg 1.13.19).

       Source-Version
           The source package version (from the changelog file). This variable is now obsolete and emits an error when used as its
           meaning is different from its function, please use the source:Version or binary:Version as appropriate.

       source:Synopsis
           The source package synopsis, extracted from the source stanza Description field, if it exists (since dpkg 1.19.0).

       source:Extended-Description
           The source package extended description, extracted from the source stanza Description field, if it exists (since dpkg
           1.19.0).

       Installed-Size
           The approximate total size of the package's installed files. This value is copied into the corresponding control file
           field; setting it will modify the value of that field. If this variable is not set dpkg-gencontrol will compute the
           default value by accumulating the size of each regular file and symlink rounded to 1 KiB used units, and a baseline of 1
           KiB for any other filesystem object type.  With hardlinks only being counted once as a regular file.

           Note: Take into account that this can only ever be an approximation, as the actual size used on the installed system
           will depend greatly on the filesystem used and its parameters, which might end up using either more or less space than
           the specified in this field.

       Extra-Size
           Additional disk space used when the package is installed. If this variable is set its value is added to that of the
           Installed-Size variable (whether set explicitly or using the default value) before it is copied into the Installed-Size
           control file field.

       S:fieldname
           The value of the source stanza field fieldname (which must be given in the canonical capitalization; since dpkg
           1.18.11).  Setting these variables has no effect other than on places where they are expanded explicitly.  These
           variables are only available when generating binary control files.

       F:fieldname
           The value of the output field fieldname (which must be given in the canonical capitalization). Setting these variables
           has no effect other than on places where they are expanded explicitly.

       Format
           The .changes file format version generated by this version of the source packaging scripts. If you set this variable the
           contents of the Format field in the .changes file will change too.

       Newline, Space, Tab
           These variables each hold the corresponding character.

       shlibs:dependencyfield
           Variable settings with names of this form are generated by dpkg-shlibdeps.

       dpkg:Upstream-Version
           The upstream version of dpkg (since dpkg 1.13.19).

       dpkg:Version
           The full version of dpkg (since dpkg 1.13.19).
