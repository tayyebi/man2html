<pre>MAILCAP.ORDER(5)                                       Order Mailcap Entries                                       MAILCAP.ORDER(5)

NAME
       /etc/mailcap.order - the mailcap ordering specifications

DESCRIPTION
       The order of entries in the /etc/mailcap file can be altered by editing the /etc/mailcap.order file.  Each line of that file
       specifies a package and an optional mime type.  Mailcap entries that match will be placed in the order of  this  file.   En‐
       tries that don't match will be placed later.

   Example
           mime-support:*/*
           gv:application/postscript
           netscape:text/html
           less:text/*
           emacs:text/*

       The  above  would  make  any entries provided by the mime-support package (as found in the /usr/lib/mime/packages directory)
       take priority over everything else.  The gv package will be used over anything else when it comes to  postscript  documents.
       Netscape will be used for any html documents and less will be used for any remaining text documents.  However, since neither
       netscape or less provide for editing documents, any edit or compose actions will fall through to the emacs rules.

       After modifying this file, be sure to run /usr/sbin/update-mime (as root) to propagate the  changes  into  the  /etc/mailcap
       file.

       Remember  that this files takes package names and not executable names.  If you want to define rules that reference specific
       programs, the best way is to include them in ~/.mailcap or the user section of the /etc/mailcap file.

LIMITATIONS
       There is currently no way to break out a certain type from a wildcard rule.  If, for example, both xv and gimp were to spec‐
       ify "image/*" rules, it isn't possible to use xv for gif images but use gimp for jpeg images.

       Also,  I  would  like  to add the ability to specify certain actions in the rules.  For example, if netscape were to have an
       edit rule but I wanted to use emacs for editing/creating html documents, I could place a line like

         emacs:text/* action=edit|compose

       before the netscape entry.  The update-mime program would then spit out entries such that netscape view  rule  comes  before
       the emacs view rule but have the netscape edit rule comes after the emacs edit rule.
