NAME
       Dpkg::Vendor::Default - default vendor class

DESCRIPTION
       A vendor class is used to provide vendor specific behaviour in various places. This is the default class used in case
       there's none for the current vendor or in case the vendor could not be identified (see Dpkg::Vendor documentation).

       It provides some hooks that are called by various dpkg-* tools.  If you need a new hook, please file a bug against dpkg-dev
       and explain your need. Note that the hook API has no guarantee to be stable over an extended period of time. If you run an
       important distribution that makes use of vendor hooks, you'd better submit them for integration so that we avoid breaking
       your code.

METHODS
       $vendor_obj = Dpkg::Vendor::Default-&gt;new()
           Creates the default vendor object. Can be inherited by all vendor objects if they don't need any specific initialization
           at object creation time.

       $vendor_obj-&gt;run_hook($id, @params)
           Run the corresponding hook. The parameters are hook-specific. The supported hooks are:

           before-source-build ($srcpkg)
                   The first parameter is a Dpkg::Source::Package object. The hook is called just before the execution of
                   $srcpkg-&gt;build().

           package-keyrings ()
                   The hook is called when dpkg-source is checking a signature on a source package (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes
                   no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.

           archive-keyrings ()
                   The hook is called when there is a need to check signatures on artifacts from repositories, for example by a
                   download method (since dpkg 1.18.11).  It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-
                   specific keyrings.

           archive-keyrings-historic ()
                   The hook is called when there is a need to check signatures on artifacts from historic repositories, for example
                   by a download method (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of
                   vendor-specific keyrings.

           builtin-build-depends ()
                   The hook is called when dpkg-checkbuilddeps is initializing the source package build dependencies (since dpkg
                   1.18.2). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific Build-Depends.

           builtin-build-conflicts ()
                   The hook is called when dpkg-checkbuilddeps is initializing the source package build conflicts (since dpkg
                   1.18.2). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific Build-Conflicts.

           register-custom-fields ()
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::Control::Fields to register custom fields.  You should return a list of arrays. Each
                   array is an operation to perform.  The first item is the name of the operation and corresponds to a field_*
                   function provided by Dpkg::Control::Fields. The remaining fields are the parameters that are passed unchanged to
                   the corresponding function.

                   Known operations are "register", "insert_after" and "insert_before".

           post-process-changelog-entry ($fields)
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::Changelog to post-process a Dpkg::Changelog::Entry after it has been created and
                   filled with the appropriate values.

           update-buildflags ($flags)
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::BuildFlags to allow the vendor to override the default values set for the various
                   build flags. $flags is a Dpkg::BuildFlags object.

           update-buildprofiles ($build_profiles_ref)
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::BuildProfiles to allow the vendor to override the default values set.
                   $build_profiles_ref is a array ref to Dpkg::BuildProfiles object.

           builtin-system-build-paths ()
                   The hook is called by dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current path should be recorded in the Build-Path
                   field (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of root paths considered
                   acceptable. As an example, if the list contains "/build/", a Build-Path field will be created if the current
                   directory is "/build/dpkg-1.18.0". If the list contains "/", the path will always be recorded. If the list is
                   empty, the current path will never be recorded.

           build-tainted-by ()
                   The hook is called by dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current system has been tainted in some way that
                   could affect the resulting build, which will be recorded in the Build-Tainted-By field (since dpkg 1.19.5). It
                   takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of tainted reason tags (formed by alphanumeric and dash
                   characters).

           sanitize-environment ()
                   The hook is called by dpkg-buildpackage to sanitize its build environment (since dpkg 1.20.0).

           backport-version-regex ()
                   The hook is called by dpkg-genchanges and dpkg-mergechangelog to determine the backport version string that
                   should be specially handled as not an earlier than version or remapped so that it does not get considered as a
                   pre-release (since dpkg 1.21.3).  The returned string is a regex with one capture group for the backport
                   delimiter string, or undef if there is no regex.

       $vendor-&gt;set_build_features($flags)
           Sets the vendor build features, which will then be used to initialize the build flags.
