       tc action ... bpf [ bytecode-file BPF_FILE | bytecode BPF_BYTECODE ]

DESCRIPTION
       Extended Berkeley Packet Filter ( eBPF ) and classic Berkeley Packet Filter (originally known as BPF, for better distinction
       referred to as cBPF here) are both available as a fully programmable and highly efficient classifier and actions. They  both
       offer a minimal instruction set for implementing small programs which can safely be loaded into the kernel and thus executed
       in a tiny virtual machine from kernel space. An in-kernel verifier guarantees that a specified program always terminates and
       neither crashes nor leaks data from the kernel.

       In  Linux,  it's generally considered that eBPF is the successor of cBPF.  The kernel internally transforms cBPF expressions
       into eBPF expressions and executes the latter. Execution of them can be performed in an interpreter or at setup  time,  they
       can be just-in-time compiled (JIT'ed) to run as native machine code.

       Currently, the eBPF JIT compiler is available for the following architectures:

       *   x86_64 (since Linux 3.18)
       *   arm64 (since Linux 3.18)
       *   s390 (since Linux 4.1)
       *   ppc64 (since Linux 4.8)
       *   sparc64 (since Linux 4.12)
       *   mips64 (since Linux 4.13)
       *   arm32 (since Linux 4.14)
       *   x86_32 (since Linux 4.18)

       Whereas the following architectures have cBPF, but did not (yet) switch to eBPF JIT support:

       *   ppc32
       *   sparc32
       *   mips32

       eBPF's  instruction  set has similar underlying principles as the cBPF instruction set, it however is modelled closer to the
       underlying architecture to better mimic native instruction sets with the aim to achieve a better run-time performance. It is
       designed  to be JIT'ed with a one to one mapping, which can also open up the possibility for compilers to generate optimized
       eBPF code through an eBPF backend that performs almost as fast as natively compiled code. Given that LLVM provides  such  an
       eBPF  backend,  eBPF programs can therefore easily be programmed in a subset of the C language. Other than that, eBPF infra‐
       structure also comes with a construct called "maps". eBPF maps are key/value stores that are shared  between  multiple  eBPF
       programs, but also between eBPF programs and user space applications.

       For  the  traffic control subsystem, classifier and actions that can be attached to ingress and egress qdiscs can be written
       in eBPF or cBPF. The advantage over other classifier and actions is that eBPF/cBPF provides  the  generic  framework,  while
       users  can  implement  their highly specialized use cases efficiently. This means that the classifier or action written that
       way will not suffer from feature bloat, and can therefore execute its task highly efficient. It allows for non-linear  clas‐
       sification  and even merging the action part into the classification. Combined with efficient eBPF map data structures, user
       space can push new policies like classids into the kernel without reloading a classifier, or it can gather  statistics  that
       are  pushed  into  one  map and use another one for dynamically load balancing traffic based on the determined load, just to
       provide a few examples.

PARAMETERS
   object-file
       points to an object file that has an executable and linkable format (ELF) and contains eBPF opcodes  and  eBPF  map  defini‐
       tions.  The  LLVM compiler infrastructure with clang(1) as a C language front end is one project that supports emitting eBPF
       object files that can be passed to the eBPF classifier (more details in the EXAMPLES section). This option is mandatory when
       an eBPF classifier or action is to be loaded.

   section
       is  the  name  of  the ELF section from the object file, where the eBPF classifier or action resides. By default the section
       name for the classifier is called "classifier", and for the action "action". Given that a single  object  file  can  contain
       multiple classifier and actions, the corresponding section name needs to be specified, if it differs from the defaults.

   export
       points  to a Unix domain socket file. In case the eBPF object file also contains a section named "maps" with eBPF map speci‐
       fications, then the map file descriptors can be handed off via the Unix domain socket to an eBPF  "agent"  herding  all  de‐
       scriptors  after tc lifetime. This can be some third party application implementing the IPC counterpart for the import, that
       uses them for calling into bpf(2) system call to read out or update eBPF map data from user space, for example, for monitor‐
       ing purposes or to push down new policies.

   verbose
       if  set,  it will dump the eBPF verifier output, even if loading the eBPF program was successful. By default, only on error,
       the verifier log is being emitted to the user.

   direct-action | da
       instructs eBPF classifier to not invoke external TC actions, instead use the TC actions return codes (TC_ACT_OK, TC_ACT_SHOT
       etc.) for classifiers.

   skip_hw | skip_sw
       hardware  offload control flags. By default TC will try to offload filters to hardware if possible.  skip_hw explicitly dis‐
       ables the attempt to offload.  skip_sw forces the offload and disables running the eBPF program in the kernel.  If  hardware
       offload is not possible and this flag was set kernel will report an error and filter will not be installed at all.

   police
       is  an  optional parameter for an eBPF/cBPF classifier that specifies a police in tc(1) which is attached to the classifier,
       for example, on an ingress qdisc.

   action
       is an optional parameter for an eBPF/cBPF classifier that specifies a subsequent action in tc(1)  which  is  attached  to  a
       classifier.

   classid
   flowid
       provides  the  default traffic control class identifier for this eBPF/cBPF classifier. The default class identifier can also
       be overwritten by the return code of the eBPF/cBPF program. A default return code of -1 specifies the here provided  default
       class identifier to be used. A return code of the eBPF/cBPF program of 0 implies that no match took place, and a return code
       other than these two will override the default classid. This allows for efficient, non-linear  classification  with  only  a
       single eBPF/cBPF program as opposed to having multiple individual programs for various class identifiers which would need to
       reparse packet contents.

   bytecode
       is being used for loading cBPF classifier and actions only. The cBPF bytecode is directly passed as a  text  string  in  the
       form of 's,c t f k,c t f k,c t f k,...'  , where s denotes the number of subsequent 4-tuples. One such 4-tuple consists of c
       t f k decimals, where c represents the cBPF opcode, t the jump true offset target, f the jump false offset target and k  the
       immediate  constant/literal.  There  are various tools that generate code in this loadable format, for example, bpf_asm that
       ships with the Linux kernel source tree under tools/net/ , so it is certainly not expected to hack this by hand.  The  byte‐
       code or bytecode-file option is mandatory when a cBPF classifier or action is to be loaded.

   bytecode-file
       also  being  used  to load a cBPF classifier or action. It's effectively the same as bytecode only that the cBPF bytecode is
       not passed directly via command line, but rather resides in a text file.

EXAMPLES
   eBPF TOOLING
       A full blown example including eBPF agent code can be found inside the iproute2 source package under: examples/bpf/

       As prerequisites, the kernel needs to have the eBPF system call namely bpf(2) enabled and ships  with  cls_bpf  and  act_bpf
       kernel  modules for the traffic control subsystem. To enable eBPF/eBPF JIT support, depending which of the two the given ar‐
       chitecture supports:

           echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable

       A given restricted C file can be compiled via LLVM as:

           clang -O2 -emit-llvm -c bpf.c -o - | llc -march=bpf -filetype=obj -o bpf.o

       The compiler invocation might still simplify in future, so for now, it's quite handy to alias this construct in one  way  or
       another, for example:

           __bcc() {
                   clang -O2 -emit-llvm -c $1 -o - | \
                   llc -march=bpf -filetype=obj -o "`basename $1 .c`.o"
           }

           alias bcc=__bcc

       A minimal, stand-alone unit, which matches on all traffic with the default classid (return code of -1) looks like:

           #include &lt;linux/bpf.h&gt;

           #ifndef __section
           # define __section(x)  __attribute__((section(x), used))
           #endif

           __section("classifier") int cls_main(struct __sk_buff *skb)
           {
                   return -1;
           }

           char __license[] __section("license") = "GPL";

       More examples can be found further below in subsection eBPF PROGRAMMING as focus here will be on tooling.

       There  can  be various other sections, for example, also for actions.  Thus, an object file in eBPF can contain multiple en‐
       trance points.  Always a specific entrance point, however, must be specified when configuring with tc.  A  license  must  be
       part  of  the restricted C code and the license string syntax is the same as with Linux kernel modules.  The kernel reserves
       its right that some eBPF helper functions can be restricted to GPL compatible licenses only, and thus may reject  a  program
       from loading into the kernel when such a license mismatch occurs.

       The  resulting object file from the compilation can be inspected with the usual set of tools that also operate on normal ob‐
       ject files, for example objdump(1) for inspecting ELF section headers:

           objdump -h bpf.o
           [...]

       Adding an eBPF classifier from an object file that contains a classifier in the default ELF section is  trivial  (note  that
       instead of "object-file" also shortcuts such as "obj" can be used):

           bcc bpf.c
           tc filter add dev em1 parent 1: bpf obj bpf.o flowid 1:1

       In case the classifier resides in ELF section "mycls", then that same command needs to be invoked as:

           tc filter add dev em1 parent 1: bpf obj bpf.o sec mycls flowid 1:1

       Dumping  the  classifier  configuration  will tell the location of the classifier, in other words that it's from object file
       "bpf.o" under section "mycls":

           tc filter show dev em1
           filter parent 1: protocol all pref 49152 bpf
           filter parent 1: protocol all pref 49152 bpf handle 0x1 flowid 1:1 bpf.o:[mycls]

       The same program can also be installed on ingress qdisc side as opposed to egress ...

           tc qdisc add dev em1 handle ffff: ingress
           tc filter add dev em1 parent ffff: bpf obj bpf.o sec mycls flowid ffff:1

       ... and again dumped from there:

           tc filter show dev em1 parent ffff:
           filter protocol all pref 49152 bpf
           filter protocol all pref 49152 bpf handle 0x1 flowid ffff:1 bpf.o:[mycls]

       Attaching a classifier and action on ingress has the restriction that it doesn't have an actual underlying  queueing  disci‐
       pline. What ingress can do is to classify, mangle, redirect or drop packets. When queueing is required on ingress side, then
       ingress must redirect packets to the ifb device, otherwise policing can be used. Moreover, ingress can be used  to  have  an
       early  drop  point of unwanted packets before they hit upper layers of the networking stack, perform network accounting with
       eBPF maps that could be shared with egress, or have an early mangle and/or redirection point  to  different  networking  de‐
       vices.

       Multiple  eBPF actions and classifier can be placed into a single object file within various sections. In that case, non-de‐
       fault section names must be provided, which is the case for both actions in this example:

           tc filter add dev em1 parent 1: bpf obj bpf.o flowid 1:1 \
                                    action bpf obj bpf.o sec action-mark \
                                    action bpf obj bpf.o sec action-rand ok

       The advantage of this is that the classifier and the two actions can then share eBPF maps with each other, if implemented in
       the programs.

       In  order to access eBPF maps from user space beyond tc(8) setup lifetime, the ownership can be transferred to an eBPF agent
       via Unix domain sockets. There are two possibilities for implementing this:

       1) implementation of an own eBPF agent that takes care of setting up the Unix domain socket and  implementing  the  protocol
       that tc(8) dictates. A code example of this can be found inside the iproute2 source package under: examples/bpf/

       2) use tc exec for transferring the eBPF map file descriptors through a Unix domain socket, and spawning an application such
       as sh(1) . This approach's advantage is that tc will place the file descriptors into the  environment  and  thus  make  them
       available just like stdin, stdout, stderr file descriptors, meaning, in case user applications run from within this fd-owner
       shell, they can terminate and restart without losing eBPF maps file descriptors. Example invocation with the previous  clas‐
       sifier and action mixture:

           tc exec bpf imp /tmp/bpf
           tc filter add dev em1 parent 1: bpf obj bpf.o exp /tmp/bpf flowid 1:1 \
                                    action bpf obj bpf.o sec action-mark \
                                    action bpf obj bpf.o sec action-rand ok

       Assuming  that  eBPF  maps are shared with classifier and actions, it's enough to export them once, for example, from within
       the classifier or action command. tc will setup all eBPF map file descriptors at the time when  the  object  file  is  first
       parsed.

       When a shell has been spawned, the environment will have a couple of eBPF related variables. BPF_NUM_MAPS provides the total
       number of maps that have been transferred over the Unix domain socket. BPF_MAP&lt;X&gt;'s value is the file descriptor number that
       can  be  accessed  in  eBPF agent applications, in other words, it can directly be used as the file descriptor value for the
       bpf(2) system call to retrieve or alter eBPF map values. &lt;X&gt; denotes the identifier of the eBPF map. It corresponds  to  the
       id member of struct bpf_elf_map  from the tc eBPF map specification.

       The environment in this example looks as follows:

           sh# env | grep BPF
               BPF_NUM_MAPS=3
               BPF_MAP1=6
               BPF_MAP0=5
               BPF_MAP2=7
           sh# ls -la /proc/self/fd
               [...]
               lrwx------. 1 root root 64 Apr 14 16:46 5 -&gt; anon_inode:bpf-map
               lrwx------. 1 root root 64 Apr 14 16:46 6 -&gt; anon_inode:bpf-map
               lrwx------. 1 root root 64 Apr 14 16:46 7 -&gt; anon_inode:bpf-map
           sh# my_bpf_agent

       eBPF agents are very useful in that they can prepopulate eBPF maps from user space, monitor statistics via maps and based on
       that feedback, for example, rewrite classids in eBPF map values during runtime. Given that eBPF agents  are  implemented  as
       normal applications, they can also dynamically receive traffic control policies from external controllers and thus push them
       down into eBPF maps to dynamically adapt to network conditions. Moreover, eBPF maps can also be shared with other eBPF  pro‐
       gram types (e.g. tracing), thus very powerful combination can therefore be implemented.

   eBPF PROGRAMMING
       eBPF  classifier  and  actions are being implemented in restricted C syntax (in future, there could additionally be new lan‐
       guage frontends supported).

       The header file linux/bpf.h provides eBPF helper functions that can be called from an eBPF program.  This man page will only
       provide  two minimal, stand-alone examples, have a look at examples/bpf from the iproute2 source package for a fully fledged
       flow dissector example to better demonstrate some of the possibilities with eBPF.

       Supported 32 bit classifier return codes from the C program and their meanings:
           0 , denotes a mismatch
           -1 , denotes the default classid configured from the command line
           else , everything else will override the default classid to provide a facility for non-linear matching

       Supported 32 bit action return codes from the C program and their meanings ( linux/pkt_cls.h ):
           TC_ACT_OK (0) , will terminate the packet processing pipeline and allows the packet to proceed
           TC_ACT_SHOT (2) , will terminate the packet processing pipeline and drops the packet
           TC_ACT_UNSPEC (-1) , will use the default action configured from tc (similarly as returning -1 from a classifier)
           TC_ACT_PIPE (3) , will iterate to the next action, if available
           TC_ACT_RECLASSIFY (1) , will terminate the packet processing pipeline and start classification from the beginning
           else , everything else is an unspecified return code

       Both classifier and action return codes are supported in eBPF and cBPF programs.

       To demonstrate restricted C syntax, a minimal toy classifier example is provided, which assumes that egress packets, for in‐
       stance  originating from a container, have previously been marked in interval [0, 255]. The program keeps statistics on dif‐
       ferent marks for user space and maps the classid to the root qdisc with the marking itself as the minor handle:

           #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
           #include &lt;asm/types.h&gt;

           #include &lt;linux/bpf.h&gt;
           #include &lt;linux/pkt_sched.h&gt;

           #include "helpers.h"

           struct tuple {
                   long packets;
                   long bytes;
           };

       Another small example is a port redirector which demuxes destination port 80 into the interval [8080, 8087] steered by  RSS,
       that  can  then  be attached to ingress qdisc. The exercise of adding the egress counterpart and IPv6 support is left to the

       Best practice, we recommend to only have a single eBPF classifier loaded in tc and perform all necessary matching  and  man‐
       gling  from  there  instead of a list of individual classifier and separate actions. Just a single classifier tailored for a
       given use-case will be most efficient to run.

   eBPF DEBUGGING
       Both tc filter and action commands for bpf support an optional verbose parameter that can be used to inspect the eBPF  veri‐
       fier log. It is dumped by default in case of an error.

       In  case  the eBPF/cBPF JIT compiler has been enabled, it can also be instructed to emit a debug output of the resulting op‐
       code image into the kernel log, which can be read via dmesg(1) :

           echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable

       The Linux kernel source tree ships additionally under tools/net/ a small helper called bpf_jit_disasm that reads out the op‐
       code image dump from the kernel log and dumps the resulting disassembly:

           bpf_jit_disasm -o

       Other than that, the Linux kernel also contains an extensive eBPF/cBPF test suite module called test_bpf . Upon ...

           modprobe test_bpf

       ...  it  performs  a diversity of test cases and dumps the results into the kernel log that can be inspected with dmesg(1) .
       The results can differ depending on whether the JIT compiler is enabled or not. In case of failed  test  cases,  the  module
       will  fail  to load. In such cases, we urge you to file a bug report to the related JIT authors, Linux kernel and networking
       mailing lists.

   cBPF
       Although we generally recommend switching to implementing eBPF classifier and actions, for the sake of completeness,  a  few
       words on how to program in cBPF will be lost here.

       Likewise,  the bpf_jit_enable switch can be enabled as mentioned already. Tooling such as bpf_jit_disasm is also independent
       whether eBPF or cBPF code is being loaded.

       Unlike in eBPF, classifier and action are not implemented in restricted C, but rather in a minimal  assembler-like  language
       or with the help of other tooling.

       The  raw interface with tc takes opcodes directly. For example, the most minimal classifier matching on every packet result‐
       ing in the default classid of 1:1 looks like:

           tc filter add dev em1 parent 1: bpf bytecode '1,6 0 0 4294967295,' flowid 1:1

       The first decimal of the bytecode sequence denotes the number of subsequent 4-tuples of cBPF opcodes. As mentioned,  such  a
       4-tuple  consists  of  c t f k decimals, where c represents the cBPF opcode, t the jump true offset target, f the jump false
       offset target and k the immediate constant/literal. Here, this denotes an unconditional return from the program with immedi‐
       ate value of -1.

       Thus, for egress classification, Willem de Bruijn implemented a minimal stand-alone helper tool under the GNU General Public
       License version 2 for iptables(8) BPF extension, which abuses the libpcap internal classic BPF compiler,  his  code  derived
       here for usage with tc(8) :

           #include &lt;pcap.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

           int main(int argc, char **argv)
           {
                   struct bpf_program prog;
                   struct bpf_insn *ins;
                   int i, ret, dlt = DLT_RAW;

                   if (argc &lt; 2 || argc &gt; 3)
                           return 1;
                   if (argc == 3) {
                           dlt = pcap_datalink_name_to_val(argv[1]);
                           if (dlt == -1)
                                   return 1;
                   }

                   ret = pcap_compile_nopcap(-1, dlt, &amp;prog, argv[argc - 1],
                                             1, PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN);
                   if (ret)
                           return 1;

                   printf("%d,", prog.bf_len);
                   ins = prog.bf_insns;

                   for (i = 0; i &lt; prog.bf_len - 1; ++ins, ++i)
                           printf("%u %u %u %u,", ins-&gt;code,
                                  ins-&gt;jt, ins-&gt;jf, ins-&gt;k);
                   printf("%u %u %u %u",
                          ins-&gt;code, ins-&gt;jt, ins-&gt;jf, ins-&gt;k);

                   pcap_freecode(&amp;prog);
                   return 0;
           }

       Given this small helper, any tcpdump(8) filter expression can be abused as a classifier where a match will result in the de‐
       fault classid:

           bpftool EN10MB 'tcp[tcpflags] &amp; tcp-syn != 0' &gt; /var/bpf/tcp-syn
           tc filter add dev em1 parent 1: bpf bytecode-file /var/bpf/tcp-syn flowid 1:1

       Basically, such a minimal generator is equivalent to:

           tcpdump -iem1 -ddd 'tcp[tcpflags] &amp; tcp-syn != 0' | tr '\n' ',' &gt; /var/bpf/tcp-syn

       Since libpcap does not support all Linux' specific cBPF extensions in its  compiler,  the  Linux  kernel  also  ships  under
       tools/net/  a  minimal  BPF assembler called bpf_asm for providing full control. For detailed syntax and semantics on imple‐
       menting such programs by hand, see references under FURTHER READING .

       Trivial toy example in bpf_asm for classifying IPv4/TCP packets, saved in a text file called foobar :

           ldh [12]
           jne #0x800, drop
           ldb [23]
           jneq #6, drop
           ret #-1
           drop: ret #0

       Similarly, such a classifier can be loaded as:

           bpf_asm foobar &gt; /var/bpf/tcp-syn
           tc filter add dev em1 parent 1: bpf bytecode-file /var/bpf/tcp-syn flowid 1:1

       For BPF classifiers, the Linux kernel provides additionally under tools/net/ a small BPF debugger called bpf_dbg , which can
       be used to test a classifier against pcap files, single-step or add various breakpoints into the classifier program and dump
       register contents during runtime.

       Implementing an action in classic BPF is rather limited in the sense that packet mangling is not supported. Therefore,  it's
       generally recommended to make the switch to eBPF, whenever possible.
