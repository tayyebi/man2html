NAME
       fuser - identify processes using files or sockets

SYNOPSIS
       fuser [-fuv] [-a|-s] [-4|-6] [-c|-m|-n space] [ -k [-i] [-M] [-w] [-SIGNAL] ] name ...
       fuser -l
       fuser -V

DESCRIPTION
       fuser displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or file systems.  In the default display mode, each file name
       is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:

              c      current directory.
              e      executable being run.
              f      open file.  f is omitted in default display mode.
              F      open file for writing.  F is omitted in default display mode.
              r      root directory.
              m      mmap'ed file or shared library.
              .      Placeholder, omitted in default display mode.

       fuser returns a non-zero return code if none of the specified files is accessed or in case of a fatal error.   If  at  least
       one access has been found, fuser returns zero.

       In order to look up processes using TCP and UDP sockets, the corresponding name space has to be selected with the -n option.
       By default fuser will look in both IPv6 and IPv4 sockets.  To change the default behavior, use the -4 and -6  options.   The
       socket(s)  can  be  specified  by the local and remote port, and the remote address.  All fields are optional, but commas in
       front of missing fields must be present:

       [lcl_port][,[rmt_host][,[rmt_port]]]

       Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP addresses and port numbers.

       fuser outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else is sent to stderr.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              Show all files specified on the command line.  By default, only files that are accessed by at least one  process  are
              shown.

       -c     Same as -m option, used for POSIX compatibility.

       -f     Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.

       -k, --kill
              Kill  processes  accessing the file.  Unless changed with -SIGNAL, SIGKILL is sent.  An fuser process never kills it‐
              self, but may kill other fuser processes.  The effective user ID of the process executing fuser is set  to  its  real
              user ID before attempting to kill.

       -i, --interactive
              Ask the user for confirmation before killing a process.  This option is silently ignored if -k is not present too.

       -I, --inode
              For  the  name  space  file let all comparisons be based on the inodes of the specified file(s) and never on the file
              names even on network based file systems.

       -l, --list-signals
              List all known signal names.

       -m NAME, --mount NAME
              NAME specifies a file on a mounted file system or a block device that is mounted.  All processes accessing  files  on
              that  file system are listed.  If a directory is specified, it is automatically changed to NAME/ to use any file sys‐
              tem that might be mounted on that directory.

       -M, --ismountpoint
              Request will be fulfilled only if NAME specifies a mountpoint.  This is an invaluable seat belt  which  prevents  you
              from killing the machine if NAME happens to not be a filesystem.

       -w     Kill only processes which have write access.  This option is silently ignored if -k is not present too.

       -n NAMESPACE, --namespace NAMESPACE
              Select a different name space.  The name spaces file (file names, the default), udp (local UDP ports), and tcp (local
              TCP ports) are supported.  For ports, either the port number or the symbolic name can be specified.  If there  is  no
              ambiguity, the shortcut notation name/space (e.g., 80/tcp) can be used.

       -s, --silent
              Silent operation.  -u and -v are ignored in this mode.  -a must not be used with -s.

       -SIGNAL
              Use  the  specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing processes.  Signals can be specified either by name (e.g.,
              -HUP) or by number (e.g., -1).  This option is silently ignored if the -k option is not used.

       -u, --user
              Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode.  Processes are shown in a ps-like style.  The fields PID, USER and COMMAND are similar to  ps.   ACCESS
              shows  how  the process accesses the file.  Verbose mode will also show when a particular file is being accessed as a
              mount point, knfs export or swap file.  In this case kernel is shown instead of the PID.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       -4, --ipv4
              Search only for IPv4 sockets.  This option must not be used with the -6 option and only has an effect  with  the  tcp
              and udp namespaces.

       -6, --ipv6
              Search  only  for  IPv6 sockets.  This option must not be used with the -4 option and only has an effect with the tcp
              and udp namespaces.

FILES
       /proc  location of the proc file system

EXAMPLES
       fuser -km /home
              kills all processes accessing the file system /home in any way.

       if fuser -s /dev/ttyS1; then :; else command; fi
              invokes command if no other process is using /dev/ttyS1.

       fuser telnet/tcp
              shows all processes at the (local) TELNET port.

RESTRICTIONS
       Processes accessing the same file or file system several times in the same way are only shown once.

       If the same object is specified several times on the command line, some of those entries may be ignored.

       fuser may only be able to gather partial information unless run with privileges.  As a consequence,  files  opened  by  pro‐
       cesses belonging to other users may not be listed and executables may be classified as mapped only.

       fuser  cannot  report  on  any processes that it doesn't have permission to look at the file descriptor table for.  The most
       common time this problem occurs is when looking for TCP or UDP sockets when running fuser as a non-root user.  In this  case
       fuser will report no access.

       Installing  fuser SUID root will avoid problems associated with partial information, but may be undesirable for security and
       privacy reasons.

       udp and tcp name spaces, and UNIX domain sockets can't be searched with kernels older than 1.3.78.

       Accesses by the kernel are only shown with the -v option.

       The -k option only works on processes.  If the user is the kernel, fuser will print an advice, but  take  no  action  beyond
       that.

       fuser will not see block devices mounted by processes in a different mount namespace.  This is due to the device ID shown in
       the process' file descriptor table being from the process namespace, not fuser's; meaning it won't match.

BUGS
       fuser -m /dev/sgX will show (or kill with the -k flag) all processes, even if you don't have that device configured.   There
       may be other devices it does this for too.

       The  mount -m option will match any file within the same device as the specified file, use the -M option as well if you mean
       to specify only the mount point.
