<pre>adjtime(3)                                            Library Functions Manual                                           adjtime(3)

NAME
       adjtime - correct the time to synchronize the system clock

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

       int adjtime(const struct timeval *delta, struct timeval *olddelta);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       adjtime():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       The adjtime() function gradually adjusts the system clock (as returned by gettimeofday(2)).  The amount of time by which the
       clock is to be adjusted is specified in the structure pointed to by delta.  This structure has the following form:

           struct timeval {
               time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
           };

       If the adjustment in delta is positive, then the system clock is speeded up by some small  percentage  (i.e.,  by  adding  a
       small amount of time to the clock value in each second) until the adjustment has been completed.  If the adjustment in delta
       is negative, then the clock is slowed down in a similar fashion.

       If a clock adjustment from an earlier adjtime() call is already in progress at the time of a later adjtime() call, and delta
       is not NULL for the later call, then the earlier adjustment is stopped, but any already completed part of that adjustment is
       not undone.

       If olddelta is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is used to return the amount of time remaining from any  previous
       adjustment that has not yet been completed.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, adjtime() returns 0.  On failure, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The adjustment in delta is outside the permitted range.

       EPERM  The  caller  does  not have sufficient privilege to adjust the time.  Under Linux, the CAP_SYS_TIME capability is re‐
              quired.

STANDARDS
       4.3BSD, System V.

NOTES
       The adjustment that adjtime() makes to the clock is carried out in such a manner that the clock is always monotonically  in‐
       creasing.   Using  adjtime()  to  adjust  the  time prevents the problems that can be caused for certain applications (e.g.,
       make(1)) by abrupt positive or negative jumps in the system time.

       adjtime() is intended to be used to make small adjustments to the system time.  Most systems impose a limit on  the  adjust‐
       ment  that can be specified in delta.  In the glibc implementation, delta must be less than or equal to (INT_MAX / 1000000 -
       2) and greater than or equal to (INT_MIN / 1000000 + 2) (respectively 2145 and -2145 seconds on i386).

BUGS
       A longstanding bug meant that if delta was specified as NULL, no valid information about the  outstanding  clock  adjustment
       was returned in olddelta.  (In this circumstance, adjtime() should return the outstanding clock adjustment, without changing
       it.)  This bug is fixed on systems with glibc 2.8 or later and Linux kernel 2.6.26 or later.
