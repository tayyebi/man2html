<pre>DebianNet(3pm)                                               dpkg suite                                              DebianNet(3pm)

NAME
       DebianNet - create, remove, enable or disable entry in /etc/inetd.

DESCRIPTION
       You can use the functions in DebianNet to to add, remove, enable or disable entries in the /etc/inetd.conf file. After the
       /etc/inetd.conf file has been changed, a SIGHUP signal will be sent to the inetd process to make sure that inetd will use
       the new /etc/inetd.conf file.  The functions can also be used to add entries that are commented out by default. They will be
       treated like normal entries. That also means that if you already have an entry that is commented out you can't add an entry
       for the same service without removing the old one first.

       The DebianNet functions treat entries that are commented out by a single '#' character as entries that have been commented
       out by a user. It will not change such entries.

       For shell scripts you can also use the update-inetd command. See update-inetd(8) for further information.

VARIABLES
       $DebianNet::INETD_CONF
           Contains a scalar filename to use as the inetd config file (e.g. for testing purposes).

           Defaults to /etc/inetd.conf.

       $DebianNet::SEP
           Contains the entry comment characters. This is only necessary if you have to deal with two (or more) services of the
           same name.

           Defaults to "#&lt;off&gt;# " as the comment characters.

       $DebianNet::MULTI
           Contains a boolean that decides whether to disable/remove more than one entry at a time. If you try to remove more than
           one entry at a time without using this option the program will show a warning and will ask the user whether to continue.

           Defaults to false.

       $DebianNet::VERBOSE
           Contains a boolean to select whether to explain verbosely what is being done.

           Defaults to false.

FUNCTIONS
       $rc = DebianNet::add_service($newentry, $group)
           Add $newentry to the group $group of the /etc/inetd.conf file. If the entry already exist it will be enabled (it will
           also detect entries with different program options). Using $group is optional (the default group is the group OTHER). If
           the group does not exist the entry will be placed at the end of the file.

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure. This function might call exit() due to debconf prompt answers.

       $rc = DebianNet::remove_service($entry)
           Remove $entry from /etc/inetd.conf. You can use a regular expression to remove the entry.

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.

       $rc = DebianNet::disable_service($service, $pattern)
           Disable $service (e.g. "ftp") in /etc/inetd.conf. Using $pattern is optional (see enable_service()).

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.

       $rc = DebianNet::enable_service($service, $pattern)
           Enable $service (e.g. "ftp") in /etc/inetd.conf. Using $pattern is optional. It can be used to select a service. You
           only need this option if you have two (or more) services of the same name.

           An example: you have three ftp entries in the /etc/inetd.conf file (all disabled by default) and you want to enable the
           entry which uses the vsftpd daemon. To do this, use the pattern "vsftpd" (or any other regular expression that matches
           this entry).

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.
