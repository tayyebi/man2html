NAME
       deb-src-symbols - Debian's extended shared library template file

SYNOPSIS
       debian/package.symbols.arch, debian/symbols.arch, debian/package.symbols, debian/symbols

DESCRIPTION
       The symbol file templates are shipped in Debian source packages, and its format is a superset of the symbols files shipped
       in binary packages, see deb-symbols(5).

   Comments
       Comments are supported in template symbol files. Any line with ‘#’ as the first character is a comment except if it starts
       with ‘#include’ (see section Using includes).  Lines starting with ‘#MISSING:’ are special comments documenting symbols that
       have disappeared.

   Using #PACKAGE# substitution
       In some rare cases, the name of the library varies between architectures.  To avoid hardcoding the name of the package in
       the symbols file, you can use the marker #PACKAGE#. It will be replaced by the real package name during installation of the
       symbols files. Contrary to the #MINVER# marker, #PACKAGE# will never appear in a symbols file inside a binary package.

   Using symbol tags
       Symbol tagging is useful for marking symbols that are special in some way.  Any symbol can have an arbitrary number of tags
       associated with it. While all tags are parsed and stored, only some of them are understood by dpkg-gensymbols and trigger
       special handling of the symbols. See subsection Standard symbol tags for reference of these tags.

       Tag specification comes right before the symbol name (no whitespace is allowed in between). It always starts with an opening
       bracket (, ends with a closing bracket ) and must contain at least one tag. Multiple tags are separated by the | character.
       Each tag can optionally have a value which is separated form the tag name by the = character. Tag names and values can be
       arbitrary strings except they cannot contain any of the special ) | = characters. Symbol names following a tag specification
       can optionally be quoted with either ' or " characters to allow whitespaces in them. However, if there are no tags specified
       for the symbol, quotes are treated as part of the symbol name which continues up until the first space.

         (tag1=i am marked|tag name with space)"tagged quoted symbol"@Base 1.0
         (optional)tagged_unquoted_symbol@Base 1.0 1
         untagged_symbol@Base 1.0

       The first symbol in the example is named tagged quoted symbol and has two tags: tag1 with value i am marked and tag name
       with space that has no value. The second symbol named tagged_unquoted_symbol is only tagged with the tag named optional. The
       last symbol is an example of the normal untagged symbol.

       Since symbol tags are an extension of the deb-symbols(5) format, they can only be part of the symbols files used in source
       packages (those files should then be seen as templates used to build the symbols files that are embedded in binary
       packages). When dpkg-gensymbols is called without the -t option, it will output symbols files compatible to the deb-
       symbols(5) format: it fully processes symbols according to the requirements of their standard tags and strips all tags from
       the output. On the contrary, in template mode (-t) all symbols and their tags (both standard and unknown ones) are kept in
       the output and are written in their original form as they were loaded.

   Standard symbol tags
       optional
           A symbol marked as optional can disappear from the library at any time and that will never cause dpkg-gensymbols to
           fail. However, disappeared optional symbols will continuously appear as MISSING in the diff in each new package
           revision.  This behaviour serves as a reminder for the maintainer that such a symbol needs to be removed from the symbol
           file or readded to the library. When the optional symbol, which was previously declared as MISSING, suddenly reappears
           in the next revision, it will be upgraded back to the “existing” status with its minimum version unchanged.

           This tag is useful for symbols which are private where their disappearance do not cause ABI breakage. For example, most
           of C++ template instantiations fall into this category. Like any other tag, this one may also have an arbitrary value:
           it could be used to indicate why the symbol is considered optional.

       arch=architecture-list
       arch-bits=architecture-bits
       arch-endian=architecture-endianness
           These tags allow one to restrict the set of architectures where the symbol is supposed to exist. The arch-bits and arch-
           endian tags are supported since dpkg 1.18.0. When the symbols list is updated with the symbols discovered in the
           library, all arch-specific symbols which do not concern the current host architecture are treated as if they did not
           exist. If an arch-specific symbol matching the current host architecture does not exist in the library, normal
           procedures for missing symbols apply and it may cause dpkg-gensymbols to fail. On the other hand, if the arch-specific
           symbol is found when it was not supposed to exist (because the current host architecture is not listed in the tag or
           does not match the endianness and bits), it is made arch neutral (i.e. the arch, arch-bits and arch-endian tags are
           dropped and the symbol will appear in the diff due to this change), but it is not considered as new.

           When operating in the default non-template mode, among arch-specific symbols only those that match the current host
           architecture are written to the symbols file. On the contrary, all arch-specific symbols (including those from foreign
           arches) are always written to the symbol file when operating in template mode.

           The format of architecture-list is the same as the one used in the Build-Depends field of debian/control (except the
           enclosing square brackets []). For example, the first symbol from the list below will be considered only on alpha,
           any-amd64 and ia64 architectures, the second only on linux architectures, while the third one anywhere except on armel.

             (arch=alpha any-amd64 ia64)64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch=linux-any)linux_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch=!armel)symbol_armel_does_not_have@Base 1.0

           The architecture-bits is either 32 or 64.

             (arch-bits=32)32bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch-bits=64)64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0

           The architecture-endianness is either little or big.

             (arch-endian=little)little_endian_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch-endian=big)big_endian_specific_symbol@Base 1.0

           Multiple restrictions can be chained.

             (arch-bits=32|arch-endian=little)32bit_le_symbol@Base 1.0

       allow-internal
           dpkg-gensymbols has a list of internal symbols that should not appear in symbols files as they are usually only side-
           effects of implementation details of the toolchain (since dpkg 1.20.1).  If for some reason, you really want one of
           those symbols to be included in the symbols file, you should tag the symbol with allow-internal.  It can be necessary
           for some low level toolchain libraries like “libgcc”.

       ignore-blacklist
           A deprecated alias for allow-internal (since dpkg 1.20.1, supported since dpkg 1.15.3).

       c++ Denotes c++ symbol pattern. See Using symbol patterns subsection below.

       symver
           Denotes symver (symbol version) symbol pattern. See Using symbol patterns subsection below.

       regex
           Denotes regex symbol pattern. See Using symbol patterns subsection below.

   Using symbol patterns
       Unlike a standard symbol specification, a pattern may cover multiple real symbols from the library. dpkg-gensymbols will
       attempt to match each pattern against each real symbol that does not have a specific symbol counterpart defined in the
       symbol file. Whenever the first matching pattern is found, all its tags and properties will be used as a basis specification
       of the symbol. If none of the patterns matches, the symbol will be considered as new.

       A pattern is considered lost if it does not match any symbol in the library. By default this will trigger a dpkg-gensymbols
       failure under -c1 or higher level. However, if the failure is undesired, the pattern may be marked with the optional tag.
       Then if the pattern does not match anything, it will only appear in the diff as MISSING. Moreover, like any symbol, the
       pattern may be limited to the specific architectures with the arch tag. Please refer to Standard symbol tags subsection
       above for more information.

       Patterns are an extension of the deb-symbols(5) format hence they are only valid in symbol file templates. Pattern
       specification syntax is not any different from the one of a specific symbol. However, symbol name part of the specification
       serves as an expression to be matched against name@version of the real symbol. In order to distinguish among different
       pattern types, a pattern will typically be tagged with a special tag.

       At the moment, dpkg-gensymbols supports three basic pattern types:

       c++ This pattern is denoted by the c++ tag. It matches only C++ symbols by their demangled symbol name (as emitted by
           c++filt(1) utility). This pattern is very handy for matching symbols which mangled names might vary across different
           architectures while their demangled names remain the same. One group of such symbols is non-virtual thunks which have
           architecture specific offsets embedded in their mangled names. A common instance of this case is a virtual destructor
           which under diamond inheritance needs a non-virtual thunk symbol. For example, even if _ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on
           32bit architectures will probably be _ZThn16_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 64bit ones, it can be matched with a single c++
           pattern:

            libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
             [...]
             (c++)"non-virtual thunk to NSB::ClassD::~ClassD()@Base" 1.0
             [...]

           The demangled name above can be obtained by executing the following command:

             $ echo '_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base' | c++filt

           Please note that while mangled name is unique in the library by definition, this is not necessarily true for demangled
           names. A couple of distinct real symbols may have the same demangled name. For example, that's the case with non-virtual
           thunk symbols in complex inheritance configurations or with most constructors and destructors (since g++ typically
           generates two real symbols for them). However, as these collisions happen on the ABI level, they should not degrade
           quality of the symbol file.

       symver
           This pattern is denoted by the symver tag. Well maintained libraries have versioned symbols where each version
           corresponds to the upstream version where the symbol got added. If that's the case, you can use a symver pattern to
           match any symbol associated to the specific version. For example:

            libc.so.6 libc6 #MINVER#
             (symver)GLIBC_2.0 2.0
             [...]
             (symver)GLIBC_2.7 2.7
             access@GLIBC_2.0 2.2

           All symbols associated with versions GLIBC_2.0 and GLIBC_2.7 will lead to minimal version of 2.0 and 2.7 respectively
           with the exception of the symbol access@GLIBC_2.0. The latter will lead to a minimal dependency on libc6 version 2.2
           despite being in the scope of the "(symver)GLIBC_2.0" pattern because specific symbols take precedence over patterns.

           Please note that while old style wildcard patterns (denoted by "*@version" in the symbol name field) are still
           supported, they have been deprecated by new style syntax "(symver|optional)version". For example, "*@GLIBC_2.0 2.0"
           should be written as "(symver|optional)GLIBC_2.0 2.0" if the same behaviour is needed.

       regex
           Regular expression patterns are denoted by the regex tag. They match by the perl regular expression specified in the
           symbol name field. A regular expression is matched as it is, therefore do not forget to start it with the ^ character or
           it may match any part of the real symbol name@version string. For example:

            libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
             (regex)"^mystack_.*@Base$" 1.0
             (regex|optional)"private" 1.0

           Symbols like "mystack_new@Base", "mystack_push@Base", "mystack_pop@Base", etc., will be matched by the first pattern
           while "ng_mystack_new@Base" would not.  The second pattern will match all symbols having the string "private" in their
           names and matches will inherit optional tag from the pattern.

       Basic patterns listed above can be combined where it makes sense. In that case, they are processed in the order in which the
       tags are specified. For example, both:

         (c++|regex)"^NSA::ClassA::Private::privmethod\d\(int\)@Base" 1.0
         (regex|c++)N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base 1.0

       will match symbols "_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod1Ei@Base" and "_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod2Ei@Base". When
       matching the first pattern, the raw symbol is first demangled as C++ symbol, then the demangled name is matched against the
       regular expression. On the other hand, when matching the second pattern, regular expression is matched against the raw
       symbol name, then the symbol is tested if it is C++ one by attempting to demangle it. A failure of any basic pattern will
       result in the failure of the whole pattern.  Therefore, for example, "__N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base" will not
       match either of the patterns because it is not a valid C++ symbol.

       In general, all patterns are divided into two groups: aliases (basic c++ and symver) and generic patterns (regex, all
       combinations of multiple basic patterns). Matching of basic alias-based patterns is fast (O(1)) while generic patterns are
       O(N) (N - generic pattern count) for each symbol.  Therefore, it is recommended not to overuse generic patterns.

       When multiple patterns match the same real symbol, aliases (first c++, then symver) are preferred over generic patterns.
       Generic patterns are matched in the order they are found in the symbol file template until the first success.  Please note,
       however, that manual reordering of template file entries is not recommended because dpkg-gensymbols generates diffs based on
       the alphanumerical order of their names.

   Using includes
       When the set of exported symbols differ between architectures, it may become inefficient to use a single symbol file. In
       those cases, an include directive may prove to be useful in a couple of ways:

       •   You can factorize the common part in some external file and include that file in your package.symbols.arch file by using
           an include directive like this:

            #include "I&lt;packages&gt;.symbols.common"

       •   The include directive may also be tagged like any symbol:

            (tag|...|tagN)#include "file-to-include"

           As a result, all symbols included from file-to-include will be considered to be tagged with tag ... tagN by default. You
           can use this feature to create a common package.symbols file which includes architecture specific symbol files:

             common_symbol1@Base 1.0
            (arch=amd64 ia64 alpha)#include "package.symbols.64bit"
            (arch=!amd64 !ia64 !alpha)#include "package.symbols.32bit"
             common_symbol2@Base 1.0

       The symbols files are read line by line, and include directives are processed as soon as they are encountered. This means
       that the content of the included file can override any content that appeared before the include directive and that any
       content after the directive can override anything contained in the included file. Any symbol (or even another #include
       directive) in the included file can specify additional tags or override values of the inherited tags in its tag
       specification. However, there is no way for the symbol to remove any of the inherited tags.

       An included file can repeat the header line containing the SONAME of the library. In that case, it overrides any header line
       previously read.  However, in general it's best to avoid duplicating header lines. One way to do it is the following:

        #include "libsomething1.symbols.common"
         arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
