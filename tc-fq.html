NAME
       FQ - Fair Queue traffic policing

SYNOPSIS
       tc  qdisc  ...  fq  [  limit PACKETS ] [ flow_limit PACKETS ] [ quantum BYTES ] [ initial_quantum BYTES ] [ maxrate RATE ] [
       buckets NUMBER ] [ orphan_mask NUMBER ] [ pacing | nopacing ] [ ce_threshold TIME ]

DESCRIPTION
       FQ (Fair Queue) is a classless packet scheduler meant to be mostly used for locally generated traffic.  It  is  designed  to
       achieve per flow pacing.  FQ does flow separation, and is able to respect pacing requirements set by TCP stack.  All packets
       belonging to a socket are considered as a 'flow'.  For non local packets (router workload), packet hash is used as fallback.

       An application can specify a maximum pacing rate using the SO_MAX_PACING_RATE setsockopt call.  This packet  scheduler  adds
       delay between packets to respect rate limitation set on each socket. Note that after linux-4.20, linux adopted EDT (Earliest
       Departure Time) and TCP directly sets the appropriate Departure Time for each skb.

       Dequeueing happens in a round-robin fashion.  A special FIFO queue is reserved for high priority packets  (  TC_PRIO_CONTROL
       priority), such packets are always dequeued first.

       FQ is non-work-conserving.

       TCP  pacing is good for flows having idle times, as the congestion window permits TCP stack to queue a possibly large number
       of packets.  This removes the 'slow start after idle' choice, badly hitting large  BDP  flows  and  applications  delivering
       chunks of data such as video streams.

PARAMETERS
   limit
       Hard limit on the real queue size. When this limit is reached, new packets are dropped. If the value is lowered, packets are
       dropped so that the new limit is met. Default is 10000 packets.

   flow_limit
       Hard limit on the maximum number of packets queued per flow.  Default value is 100.

   quantum
       The credit per dequeue RR round, i.e. the amount of bytes a flow is allowed to dequeue at  once.  A  larger  value  means  a
       longer time period before the next flow will be served.  Default is 2 * interface MTU bytes.

   initial_quantum
       The  initial sending rate credit, i.e. the amount of bytes a new flow is allowed to dequeue initially.  This is specifically
       meant to allow using IW10 without added delay.  Default is 10 * interface MTU, i.e. 15140 for 'standard' ethernet.

   maxrate
       Maximum sending rate of a flow.  Default is unlimited.  Application specific setting via SO_MAX_PACING_RATE is ignored  only
       if it is larger than this value.

   buckets
       The  size of the hash table used for flow lookups. Each bucket is assigned a red-black tree for efficient collision sorting.
       Default: 1024.

   orphan_mask
       For packets not owned by a socket, fq is able to mask a part of skb-&gt;hash and reduce number of buckets associated  with  the
       traffic.  This  is  a  DDOS prevention mechanism, and the default is 1023 (meaning no more than 1024 flows are allocated for
       these packets)

   [no]pacing
       Enable or disable flow pacing. Default is enabled.

   ce_threshold
       sets a threshold above which all packets are marked with ECN Congestion Experienced. This is useful for DCTCP-style  conges‐
       tion control algorithms that require marking at very shallow queueing thresholds.

       #tc qdisc add dev eth0 root fq ce_threshold 4ms
