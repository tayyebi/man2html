<pre>GNOME-SESSION(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                      GNOME-SESSION(1)

NAME
       gnome-session - Start the GNOME desktop environment

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-session [-a|--autostart=DIR] [--session=SESSION] [--failsafe|-f] [--debug] [--whale]

DESCRIPTION
       The  gnome-session program starts up the GNOME desktop environment. This command is typically executed by your login manager
       (either gdm, xdm, or from your X startup scripts). It will load either your saved session, or it will provide a default ses‐
       sion  for  the  user  as  defined  by the system administrator (or the default GNOME installation on your system). Note that
       gnome-session is a wrapper script for gnome-session-binary.

       The default session is defined in gnome.session, a .desktop-like file that  is  looked  for  in  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-ses‐
       sion/sessions, $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions and $XDG_DATA_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions.

       When  saving  a session, gnome-session saves the currently running applications in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/saved-
       session directory. Saving sessions is only supported with the legacy non-systemd startup method.

       gnome-session is an X11R6 session manager. It can manage GNOME applications as well as any X11R6 SM compliant application.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --autostart=DIR
              The directory DIR to be searched for autostart .desktop files. This option can be used multiple times.  When this op‐
              tion is present, then default autostart directories will not be searched.

       --session=SESSION
              Use the applications defined in SESSION.session. If not specified, gnome.session will be used.

       --builtin
              Use the legacy non-systemd method of managing the user session. This is the opposite of the --systemd option.

       --systemd
              Use the systemd method of managing the user session. This is the opposite of the --builtin option.

       --failsafe
              Run in fail-safe mode. User-specified applications will not be started.

       --debug
              Enable debugging code.

       --whale
              Show the fail whale in a dialog for debugging it.

SESSION DEFINITION
       Sessions  are defined in .session files, that are using a .desktop-like format, with the following keys in the GNOME Session
       group:

       Name   Name of the session. This can be localized.

       RequiredComponents
              List of component identifiers (desktop files) that are required by the session. The required components  will  always
              run in the session.

       Here is an example of a session definition:

           [GNOME Session]
           Name=GNOME
           RequiredComponents=gnome-shell;gnome-settings-daemon;

       In  systemd managed sessions the RequiredComponents may be provided by systemd units instead. In this case the corresponding
       .desktop file needs to contain X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd=true. gnome-session will ignore these components and rely on  sys‐
       temd to manage them appropriately, see the systemd for more information on how this works.

       The  .session  files  are looked for in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/sessions, $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions and
       $XDG_DATA_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions.

systemd
       gnome-session can pass much of the session management over to systemd (see the --systemd option which  may  be  the  default
       since  3.34).  In this case, startup components that have X-GNOME-HiddenUnderSystemd=true set in their .desktop file will be
       ignored by gnome-session. It instead relies on the fact that these components are managed by systemd.

       As of GNOME 3.34 the systemd support is new and the customizing the configuration is not yet  easily  possible.  With  GNOME
       3.34 it may be best to use --builtin if session customizations are required. This is due to the way that GNOME currently de‐
       fines the components that will be started on each session type.

       systemd provides the two special targets graphical-session.target and graphical-session-pre.target  which  are  fully  func‐
       tional and should be used. gnome-session provides the following main targets:

       gnome-session.target
              Generic unit that will be active throughout the session. Similar to graphical-session.target.

       gnome-session-pre.target
              Used for tasks that need to be done before session startup. Similar to graphical-session-pre.target.

       gnome-session-x11@SESSION.target gnome-session-wayland@SESSION.target
              Main unit started for X11/wayland based session. SESSION is set according to the session that is passed in --session.

       gnome-session-x11.target gnome-session-wayland.target
              Convenience units without the session embedded into the target.

       gnome-session@SESSION.target
              Convenience unit with just the SESSION information embedded.

       gnome-session-x11-services.target
              Special  unit  started when X11 services are needed. This will be used from GNOME 3.36 onwards. Programs will need to
              use the special GNOME_SETUP_DISPLAY environment variable instead of DISPLAY.

       Note that care must be taken to set appropriate After= rules. It is also strongly recommended to always do this in  combina‐
       tion with BindsTo= or PartOf= on one of the core targets (e.g. graphical-session.target).

       Units are required to set CollectMode=inactive-or-failed. In addition, it is strongly recommended to set TimeoutStopSec=5 so
       that logout will not be delayed indefinitely in case the process does not stop properly.

ENVIRONMENT
       gnome-session sets several environment variables for the use of its child processes:

       SESSION_MANAGER

              This variable is used by session-manager aware clients to contact gnome-session.

       DISPLAY

              This variable is set to the X display being used by gnome-session. Note that if the --display  option  is  used  this
              might be different from the setting of the environment variable when gnome-session is invoked.

       Behavior of gnome-session ifself can be modified via the following environment variable:

       GNOME_SESSION_AUTOSTART_DIR

              This variable specifies a list of directories to the searched for autostart files. This variable overrides all direc‐
              tories specified via the --autostart option, as well as all default autostart directories.

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/autostart /usr/share/gnome/autostart

              Applications defined via .desktop files in those directories will be started on  login.   gnome-session-properties(1)
              can be used to easily configure them.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/sessions $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions $XDG_DATA_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions

              These directories contain the .session files that can be used with the --session option.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/saved-session

              This directory contains the list of applications of the saved session.
