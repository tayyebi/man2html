NAME
       Glib::MakeHelper - Makefile.PL utilities for Glib-based extensions

SYNOPSIS
        eval "use Glib::MakeHelper; 1"
            or complain_that_glib_is_too_old_and_die();

        %xspod_files = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;do_pod_files (@xs_files);

        package MY;
        sub postamble {
            return Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_clean ()
                 . Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_docs (@main::xs_files)
                 . Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_rpms (
                        MYLIB     =&gt; $build_reqs{MyLib},
                   );
        }

DESCRIPTION
       The Makefile.PL for your typical Glib-based module is huge and hairy, thanks to all the crazy hoops you have to jump through
       to get things right.  This module wraps up some of the more intense and error-prone bits to reduce the amount of copied code
       and potential for errors.

METHODS
       HASH = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;do_pod_files (@xs_files)
           Scan the @xs_files and return a hash describing the pod files that will be created.  This is in the format wanted by
           WriteMakefile(). If @ARGV contains the string "disable-apidoc" an empty list will be returned and thus no apidoc pod
           will be generated speeding up the build process.

       LIST = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;select_files_by_version ($stem, $major, $minor)
           Returns a list of all files that match "$stem-\d+\.\d+" and for which the first number is bigger than $major and the
           second number is bigger than $minor.  If $minor is odd, it will be incremented by one so that the version number of an
           upcoming stable release can be used during development as well.

       LIST = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;read_source_list_file ($filename)
           Reads $filename, removes all comments (starting with "#") and leading and trailing whitespace, and returns a list of all
           lines that survived the treatment.

       string = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;get_configure_requires_yaml (%module_to_version)
           Generates YAML code that lists every module found in %module_to_version under the "configure_requires" key.  This can be
           used with ExtUtils::MakeMaker's "EXTRA_META" parameter to specify which modules are needed at Makefile.PL time.

           This function is deprecated since ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.46 removed support for "EXTRA_META" in favor of the new keys
           "META_MERGE" and "META_ADD".

       string = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_clean (@files)
           Create and return the text of a realclean rule that cleans up after much of the autogeneration performed by Glib-based
           modules.  Everything in @files will be deleted, too (it may be empty).

           The reasoning behind using this instead of just having you use the 'clean' or 'realclean' keys is that this avoids you
           having to remember to put Glib's stuff in your Makefile.PL's WriteMakefile arguments.

       string = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_docs (@xs_files)
           NOTE: this is The Old Way.  see postamble_docs_full for The New Way.

           Create and return the text of Makefile rules to build documentation from the XS files with Glib::ParseXSDoc and
           Glib::GenPod.

           Use this in your MY::postamble to enable autogeneration of POD.

           This updates dependencies with the list of pod names generated by an earlier run of "do_pod_files".

           There is a special Makefile variable POD_DEPENDS that should be set to the list of files that need to be created before
           the doc.pl step is run, include files.

           There is also a variable BLIB_DONE which should be used as a dependency anywhere a rule needs to be sure that a loadable
           and working module resides in the blib directory before running.

       string = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_docs_full (...)
           Create and return the text of Makefile rules to build documentation from the XS files with Glib::ParseXSDoc and
           Glib::GenPod.

           Use this in your MY::postamble to enable autogeneration of POD.

           This updates dependencies with the list of pod names generated by an earlier run of "do_pod_files".

           There is a special Makefile variable POD_DEPENDS that should be set to the list of files that need to be created before
           the doc.pl step is run, include files.

           There is also a variable BLIB_DONE which should be used as a dependency anywhere a rule needs to be sure that a loadable
           and working module resides in the blib directory before running.

           The parameters are a list of key=&gt;value pairs.  You must specify at minimum either DEPENDS or XS_FILES.

           DEPENDS =&gt; ExtUtils::Depends object
               Most gtk2-perl modules use ExtUtils::Depends to find headers, typemaps, and other data from parent modules and to
               install this data for child modules.  We can find from this object the list of XS files to scan for documentation,
               doctype mappings for parent modules, and other goodies.

           XS_FILES =&gt; \@xs_file_names
               A list of xs files to scan for documentation.  Ignored if DEPENDS is used.

           DOCTYPES =&gt; \@doctypes_file_names
               List of filenames to pass to "Glib::GenPod::add_types".  May be omitted.

           COPYRIGHT =&gt; string
               POD text to be inserted in the 'COPYRIGHT' section of each generated page.  May be omitted.

           COPYRIGHT_FROM =&gt; file name
               The name of a file containing the POD to be inserted in the 'COPYRIGHT' section of each generated page.  May be
               omitted.

           NAME =&gt; extension name
               The name of the extension, used to set the main mod for Glib::GenPod (used in the generated see-also listings).  May
               be omitted in favor of the name held inside the ExtUtils::Depends object.  If DEPENDS is also specified, NAME wins.

       string = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_rpms (HASH)
           Create and return the text of Makefile rules to manage building RPMs.  You'd put this in your Makefile.PL's
           MY::postamble.

           HASH is a set of search and replace keys for the spec file.  All occurrences of @key@ in the spec file template
           perl-$(DISTNAME).spec.in will be replaced with value.  'VERSION' and 'SOURCE' are supplied for you.  For example:

            Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_rpms (
                   MYLIB     =&gt; 2.0.0, # we can work with anything from this up
                   MYLIB_RUN =&gt; 2.3.1, # we are actually compiled against this one
                   PERL_GLIB =&gt; 1.01,  # you must have this version of Glib
            );

           will replace @MYLIB@, @MYLIB_RUN@, and @PERL_GLIB@ in spec file.  See the build setups for Glib and Gtk2 for examples.

           Note: This function just returns an empty string on Win32.

       string = Glib::MakeHelper-&gt;postamble_precompiled_headers (@headers)
           Create and return the text of Makefile rules for a 'precompiled-headers' target that precompiles @headers.  If you call
           this before you call "postamble_clean", all temporary files will be removed by the 'realclean' target.

NOTICE
       The MakeMaker distributed with perl 5.8.x generates makefiles with a bug that causes object files to be created in the wrong
       directory.  There is an override inserted by this module under the name MY::const_cccmd to fix this issue.
