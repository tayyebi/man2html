DESCRIPTION
       addr2line translates addresses or symbol+offset into file names and line numbers.  Given an address or symbol+offset in an
       executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file
       name and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option.  The default is the file a.out.  The section in
       the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option.

       addr2line has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset are specified on the command line, and addr2line displays the file name
       and line number for each address.

       In the second, addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset from standard input, and prints the file name and line
       number for each address on standard output.  In this mode, addr2line may be used in a pipe to convert dynamically chosen
       addresses.

       The format of the output is FILENAME:LINENO.  By default each input address generates one line of output.

       Two options can generate additional lines before each FILENAME:LINENO line (in that order).

       If the -a option is used then a line with the input address is displayed.

       If the -f option is used, then a line with the FUNCTIONNAME is displayed.  This is the name of the function containing the
       address.

       One option can generate additional lines after the FILENAME:LINENO line.

       If the -i option is used and the code at the given address is present there because of inlining by the compiler then
       additional lines are displayed afterwards.  One or two extra lines (if the -f option is used) are displayed for each inlined
       function.

       Alternatively if the -p option is used then each input address generates a single, long, output line containing the address,
       the function name, the file name and the line number.  If the -i option has also been used then any inlined functions will
       be displayed in the same manner, but on separate lines, and prefixed by the text (inlined by).

       If the file name or function name can not be determined, addr2line will print two question marks in their place.  If the
       line number can not be determined, addr2line will print 0.

       When symbol+offset is used, +offset is optional, except when the symbol is ambigious with a hex number. The resolved symbols
       can be mangled or unmangled, except unmangled symbols with + are not allowed.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       -a
       --addresses
           Display the address before the function name, file and line number information.  The address is printed with a 0x prefix
           to easily identify it.

       -b bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is bfdname.

       -C
       --demangle[=style]
           Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level names.  Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by
           the system, this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have different mangling styles. The optional
           demangling style argument can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       -e filename
       --exe=filename
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be translated.  The default file is a.out.

       -f
       --functions
           Display function names as well as file and line number information.

       -s
       --basenames
           Display only the base of each file name.

       -i
       --inlines
           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source information for all enclosing scopes back to the first
           non-inlined function will also be printed.  For example, if "main" inlines "callee1" which inlines "callee2", and
           address is from "callee2", the source information for "callee1" and "main" will also be printed.

       -j
       --section
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute addresses.

       -p
       --pretty-print
           Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on one line.  If option -i is specified, lines for all
           enclosing scopes are prefixed with (inlined by).

       -r
       -R
       --recurse-limit
       --no-recurse-limit
       --recursion-limit
       --no-recursion-limit
           Enables or disables a limit on the amount of recursion performed whilst demangling strings.  Since the name mangling
           formats allow for an infinite level of recursion it is possible to create strings whose decoding will exhaust the amount
           of stack space available on the host machine, triggering a memory fault.  The limit tries to prevent this from happening
           by restricting recursion to 2048 levels of nesting.

           The default is for this limit to be enabled, but disabling it may be necessary in order to demangle truly complicated
           names.  Note however that if the recursion limit is disabled then stack exhaustion is possible and any bug reports about
           such an event will be rejected.

           The -r option is a synonym for the --no-recurse-limit option.  The -R option is a synonym for the --recurse-limit
           option.

           Note this option is only effective if the -C or --demangle option has been enabled.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does
           not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the
           entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the
           character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional @file options; any such options will
           be processed recursively.
