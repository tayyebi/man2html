NAME
       badblocks - search a device for bad blocks

SYNOPSIS
       badblocks  [  -svwnfBX  ]  [  -b  block_size ] [ -c blocks_at_once ] [ -d read_delay_factor ] [ -e max_bad_blocks ] [ -i in‐
       put_file ] [ -o output_file ] [ -p num_passes ] [ -t test_pattern ] device [ last_block ] [ first_block ]

DESCRIPTION
       badblocks is used to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a disk partition).  device is the special file corresponding
       to  the  device  (e.g /dev/hdc1).  last_block is the last block to be checked; if it is not specified, the last block on the
       device is used as a default.  first_block is an optional parameter specifying the starting block number for the test,  which
       allows  the testing to start in the middle of the disk.  If it is not specified the first block on the disk is used as a de‐
       fault.

       Important note: If the output of badblocks is going to be fed to the e2fsck or mke2fs programs, it  is  important  that  the
       block size is properly specified, since the block numbers which are generated are very dependent on the block size in use by
       the file system.  For this reason, it is strongly recommended that users not run badblocks directly, but rather use  the  -c
       option of the e2fsck and mke2fs programs.

OPTIONS
       -b block_size
              Specify the size of blocks in bytes.  The default is 1024.

       -c number of blocks
              is the number of blocks which are tested at a time.  The default is 64.

       -d read delay factor
              This  parameter, if passed and non-zero, will cause bad blocks to sleep between reads if there were no errors encoun‐
              tered in the read operation; the delay will be calculated as a percentage of the time it took for the read  operation
              to  be  performed.  In other words, a value of 100 will cause each read to be delayed by the amount the previous read
              took, and a value of 200 by twice the amount.

       -e max bad block count
              Specify a maximum number of bad blocks before aborting the test.  The default is 0, meaning the  test  will  continue
              until the end of the test range is reached.

       -f     Normally,  badblocks will refuse to do a read/write or a non-destructive test on a device which is mounted, since ei‐
              ther can cause the system to potentially crash and/or damage the file system even if it is mounted  read-only.   This
              can  be  overridden  using the -f flag, but should almost never be used --- if you think you're smarter than the bad‐
              blocks program, you almost certainly aren't.  The only time when this option might be safe to use is if the /etc/mtab
              file is incorrect, and the device really isn't mounted.

       -i input_file
              Read  a  list of already existing known bad blocks.  Badblocks will skip testing these blocks since they are known to
              be bad.  If input_file is specified as "-", the list will be read from the standard input.   Blocks  listed  in  this
              list  will  be omitted from the list of new bad blocks produced on the standard output or in the output file.  The -b
              option of dumpe2fs(8) can be used to retrieve the list of blocks currently marked bad on an existing file system,  in
              a format suitable for use with this option.

       -n     Use non-destructive read-write mode.  By default only a non-destructive read-only test is done.  This option must not
              be combined with the -w option, as they are mutually exclusive.

       -o output_file
              Write the list of bad blocks to the specified file.  Without this option, badblocks displays the list on its standard
              output.  The format of this file is suitable for use by the -l option in e2fsck(8) or mke2fs(8).

       -p num_passes
              Repeat  scanning  the disk until there are no new blocks discovered in num_passes consecutive scans of the disk.  De‐
              fault is 0, meaning badblocks will exit after the first pass.

       -s     Show the progress of the scan by writing out rough percentage completion of the current badblocks pass over the disk.
              Note  that  badblocks may do multiple test passes over the disk, in particular if the -p or -w option is requested by
              the user.

       -t test_pattern
              Specify a test pattern to be read (and written) to disk blocks.   The test_pattern may either be a numeric value  be‐
              tween  0 and ULONG_MAX-1 inclusive, or the word "random", which specifies that the block should be filled with a ran‐
              dom bit pattern.  For read/write (-w) and non-destructive (-n) modes, one or more test patterns may be  specified  by
              specifying  the  -t  option for each test pattern desired.  For read-only mode only a single pattern may be specified
              and it may not be "random".  Read-only testing with a pattern assumes that the specified pattern has previously  been
              written  to  the  disk  - if not, large numbers of blocks will fail verification.  If multiple patterns are specified
              then all blocks will be tested with one pattern before proceeding to the next pattern.

       -v     Verbose mode.  Will write the number of read errors, write errors and data- corruptions to stderr.

       -w     Use write-mode test. With this option, badblocks scans for bad blocks by writing some  patterns  (0xaa,  0x55,  0xff,
              0x00)  on every block of the device, reading every block and comparing the contents.  This option may not be combined
              with the -n option, as they are mutually exclusive.

       -B     Use buffered I/O and do not use Direct I/O, even if it is available.

       -X     Internal flag only to be used by e2fsck(8) and mke2fs(8).  It bypasses the exclusive mode in-use device safety check.

WARNING
       Never use the -w option on a device containing an existing file system.  This option erases data!  If you want to do  write-
       mode testing on an existing file system, use the -n option instead.  It is slower, but it will preserve your data.

       The -e option will cause badblocks to output a possibly incomplete list of bad blocks. Therefore it is recommended to use it
       only when one wants to know if there are any bad blocks at all on the device, and not when the list of bad blocks is wanted.
