DESCRIPTION
       FQ-PIE (Flow Queuing with Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) is a queuing discipline that combines Flow Queuing with
       the PIE AQM scheme. FQ-PIE uses a Jenkins hash function to classify incoming packets into different flows  and  is  used  to
       provide a fair share of the bandwidth to all the flows using the qdisc. Each such flow is managed by the PIE algorithm.

ALGORITHM
       The  FQ-PIE  algorithm  consists of two logical parts: the scheduler which selects which queue to dequeue a packet from, and
       the PIE AQM which works on each of the queues. The major work of FQ-PIE is mostly in the scheduling  part.  The  interaction
       between the scheduler and the PIE algorithm is straight forward.

       During  the  enqueue stage, a hashing-based scheme is used, where flows are hashed into a number of buckets with each bucket
       having its own queue. The number of buckets is configurable, and presently defaults to 1024 in the implementation.  The flow
       hashing  is  performed  on the 5-tuple of source and destination IP addresses, port numbers and IP protocol number. Once the
       packet has been successfully classified into a queue, it is handed over to the PIE algorithm for enqueuing. It is then added
       to  the  tail of the selected queue, and the queue's byte count is updated by the packet size. If the queue is not currently
       active (i.e., if it is not in either the list of new or the list of old queues) , it is added to the end of the list of  new
       queues,  and its number of credits is initiated to the configured quantum. Otherwise, the queue is left in its current queue
       list.

       During the dequeue stage, the scheduler first looks at the list of new queues; for the queue at the head of  that  list,  if
       that  queue has a negative number of credits (i.e., it has already dequeued at least a quantum of bytes), it is given an ad‐
       ditional quantum of credits, the queue is put onto the end of the list of old queues, and the routine selects the next queue
       and  starts  again.  Otherwise,  that queue is selected for dequeue again. If the list of new queues is empty, the scheduler
       proceeds down the list of old queues in the same fashion (checking the credits, and either selecting the queue  for  dequeu‐
       ing,  or  adding credits and putting the queue back at the end of the list). After having selected a queue from which to de‐
       queue a packet, the PIE algorithm is invoked on that queue.

       Finally, if the PIE algorithm does not return a packet, then the queue must be empty and  the  scheduler  does  one  of  two
       things:

       If the queue selected for dequeue came from the list of new queues, it is moved to the end of the list of old queues. If in‐
       stead it came from the list of old queues, that queue is removed from the list, to be added back (as a new queue)  the  next
       time a packet arrives that hashes to that queue. Then (since no packet was available for dequeue), the whole dequeue process
       is restarted from the beginning.

       If, instead, the scheduler did get a packet back from the PIE algorithm, it subtracts the size of the packet from  the  byte
       credits for the selected queue and returns the packet as the result of the dequeue operation.

PARAMETERS
   limit
       It  is  the limit on the queue size in packets. Incoming packets are dropped when the limit is reached. The default value is
       10240 packets.

   flows
       It is the number of flows into which the incoming packets are classified. Due to the stochastic nature of hashing,  multiple
       flows  may end up being hashed into the same slot. Newer flows have priority over older ones. This parameter can be set only
       at load time since memory has to be allocated for the hash table. The default value is 1024.

   target
       It is the queue delay which the PIE algorithm tries to maintain. The default target delay is 15ms.

   tupdate
       It is the time interval at which the system drop probability is calculated.  The default is 15ms.

   alpha
   beta
       alpha and beta are parameters chosen to control the drop probability. These should be in the range between 0 and 32.

   quantum
       quantum signifies the number of bytes that may be dequeued from a queue before switching to the next queue  in  the  deficit
       round robin scheme.

   memory_limit
       It is the maximum total memory allowed for packets of all flows. The default is 32Mb.

   ecn_prob
       It  is the drop probability threshold below which packets will be ECN marked instead of getting dropped. The default is 10%.
       Setting this parameter requires ecn to be enabled.

   [no]ecn
       It has the same semantics as pie and can be used to mark packets instead of dropping them. If ecn has  been  enabled,  noecn
       can be used to turn it off and vice-a-versa.

   [no]bytemode
       It  is used to scale drop probability proportional to packet size bytemode to turn on bytemode, nobytemode to turn off byte‐
       mode. By default, bytemode is turned off.

   [no_]dq_rate_estimator
       dq_rate_estimator can be used to calculate queue delay using Little's Law, no_dq_rate_estimator can  be  used  to  calculate
       queue delay using timestamp. By default, dq_rate_estimator is turned off.
