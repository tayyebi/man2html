<pre>DELUSER.CONF(5)                                         File Formats Manual                                         DELUSER.CONF(5)

NAME
       /etc/deluser.conf - configuration file for  deluser(8) and delgroup(8).

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/deluser.conf contains defaults for the programs deluser(8) and delgroup(8).  Each option takes the form option
       = value.  Double or single quotes are allowed around the value.  Comment lines must have a hash sign (#) at the beginning of
       the line.

       deluser(8) and delgroup(8) also read /etc/adduser.conf, see adduser.conf(5); settings in deluser.conf may overwrite settings
       made in adduser.conf.

       The valid configuration options are:

       REMOVE_HOME
              Removes the home directory and mail spool of the user to be removed.  Value may be 0 (don't delete) or 1 (do delete).

       REMOVE_ALL_FILES
              Removes all files on the system owned by the user to be removed.  If this option is activated REMOVE_HOME has no  ef‐
              fect.  Values may be 0 or 1.

       BACKUP If  REMOVE_HOME  or  REMOVE_ALL_FILES is activated, all files are backed up before they are removed.  The backup file
              that is created defaults to username.tar(.gz|.bz2) in the directory specified by the BACKUP_TO option.  The  compres‐
              sion method is chosen to the best that is available.  Values may be 0 or 1.

       BACKUP_TO
              If BACKUP is activated, BACKUP_TO If BACKUP is activated, BACKUP_TO specifies the directory the backup is written to.
              Default is the current directory.

       NO_DEL_PATHS
              A list of regular expressions, space separated.  All files to be deleted in course of deleting the home directory  or
              user-owned  files  elsewhere are checked against each of these regular expressions.  If a match is detected, the file
              is not deleted.  Default to a list of system directories, leaving only /home.  Therefore only files below  /home  be‐
              longing to that specific user are going to be deleted.

       ONLY_IF_EMPTY
              Only delete a group if there are no users belonging to this group.  Defaults to 0.

       EXCLUDE_FSTYPES
              A regular expression which describes all file systems which should be excluded when looking for files of a user to be
              deleted. Defaults to "(proc|sysfs|usbfs|devtmpfs|devpts|afs)".
