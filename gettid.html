<pre>gettid(2)                                               System Calls Manual                                               gettid(2)

NAME
       gettid - get thread identification

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       pid_t gettid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       gettid() returns the caller's thread ID (TID).  In a single-threaded process, the thread ID is equal to the process ID (PID,
       as returned by getpid(2)).  In a multithreaded process, all threads have the same PID, but each one has a unique  TID.   For
       further details, see the discussion of CLONE_THREAD in clone(2).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns the thread ID of the calling thread.

ERRORS
       This call is always successful.

VERSIONS
       The  gettid() system call first appeared in Linux 2.4.11.  Library support was added in glibc 2.30.  (Earlier glibc versions
       did not provide a wrapper for this system call, necessitating the use of syscall(2).)

STANDARDS
       gettid() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are intended to be portable.

NOTES
       The thread ID returned by this call is not the same thing as  a  POSIX  thread  ID  (i.e.,  the  opaque  value  returned  by
       pthread_self(3)).

       In  a  new  thread  group  created  by  a clone(2) call that does not specify the CLONE_THREAD flag (or, equivalently, a new
       process created by fork(2)), the new process is a thread group leader, and its thread group ID (the value returned  by  get‐
       pid(2)) is the same as its thread ID (the value returned by gettid()).
