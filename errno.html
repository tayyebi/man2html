<pre>errno(3)                                              Library Functions Manual                                             errno(3)

NAME
       errno - number of last error

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;errno.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       The &lt;errno.h&gt; header file defines the integer variable errno, which is set by system calls and some library functions in the
       event of an error to indicate what went wrong.

   errno
       The value in errno is significant only when the return value of the call indicated an  error  (i.e.,  -1  from  most  system
       calls;  -1 or NULL from most library functions); a function that succeeds is allowed to change errno.  The value of errno is
       never set to zero by any system call or library function.

       For some system calls and library functions (e.g., getpriority(2)), -1 is a valid return on success.  In such cases, a  suc‐
       cessful return can be distinguished from an error return by setting errno to zero before the call, and then, if the call re‐
       turns a status that indicates that an error may have occurred, checking to see if errno has a nonzero value.

       errno is defined by the ISO C standard to be a modifiable lvalue of type int, and must not be explicitly declared; errno may
       be a macro.  errno is thread-local; setting it in one thread does not affect its value in any other thread.

   Error numbers and names
       Valid error numbers are all positive numbers.  The &lt;errno.h&gt; header file defines symbolic names for each of the possible er‐
       ror numbers that may appear in errno.

       All the error names specified by POSIX.1 must have distinct values, with the exception of EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK, which  may
       be the same.  On Linux, these two have the same value on all architectures.

       The error numbers that correspond to each symbolic name vary across UNIX systems, and even across different architectures on
       Linux.  Therefore, numeric values are not included as part of the list of error names below.  The perror(3) and  strerror(3)
       functions can be used to convert these names to corresponding textual error messages.

       On  any particular Linux system, one can obtain a list of all symbolic error names and the corresponding error numbers using
       the errno(1) command (part of the moreutils package):

           $ errno -l
           EPERM 1 Operation not permitted
           ENOENT 2 No such file or directory
           ESRCH 3 No such process
           EINTR 4 Interrupted system call
           EIO 5 Input/output error
           ...

       The errno(1) command can also be used to look up individual error numbers and names, and to search for errors using  strings
       from the error description, as in the following examples:

           $ errno 2
           ENOENT 2 No such file or directory
           $ errno ESRCH
           ESRCH 3 No such process
           $ errno -s permission
           EACCES 13 Permission denied

   List of error names
       In the list of the symbolic error names below, various names are marked as follows:

       POSIX.1-2001
              The name is defined by POSIX.1-2001, and is defined in later POSIX.1 versions, unless otherwise indicated.

       POSIX.1-2008
              The name is defined in POSIX.1-2008, but was not present in earlier POSIX.1 standards.

       C99    The name is defined by C99.

       Below is a list of the symbolic error names that are defined on Linux:

       E2BIG           Argument list too long (POSIX.1-2001).

                       rectory prefix of a pathname does not exist, or the specified pathname is a dangling symbolic link.

       ETOOMANYREFS    Too many references: cannot splice.

       ETXTBSY         Text file busy (POSIX.1-2001).

       EUCLEAN         Structure needs cleaning.

       EUNATCH         Protocol driver not attached.

       EUSERS          Too many users.

       EWOULDBLOCK     Operation would block (may be same value as EAGAIN) (POSIX.1-2001).

       EXDEV           Invalid cross-device link (POSIX.1-2001).

       EXFULL          Exchange full.

NOTES
       A common mistake is to do

           if (somecall() == -1) {
               printf("somecall() failed\n");
               if (errno == ...) { ... }
           }

       where errno no longer needs to have the value it had upon return from somecall() (i.e., it may  have  been  changed  by  the
       printf(3)).  If the value of errno should be preserved across a library call, it must be saved:

           if (somecall() == -1) {
               int errsv = errno;
               printf("somecall() failed\n");
               if (errsv == ...) { ... }
           }

       Note that the POSIX threads APIs do not set errno on error.  Instead, on failure they return an error number as the function
       result.  These error numbers have the same meanings as the error numbers returned in errno by other APIs.

       On some ancient systems, &lt;errno.h&gt; was not present or did not declare errno, so that it was necessary to declare errno manu‐
       ally  (i.e., extern int errno).  Do not do this.  It long ago ceased to be necessary, and it will cause problems with modern
       versions of the C library.
