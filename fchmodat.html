DESCRIPTION
       The  chmod()  and fchmod() system calls change a file's mode bits.  (The file mode consists of the file permission bits plus
       the set-user-ID, set-group-ID, and sticky bits.)  These system calls differ only in how the file is specified:

       •  chmod() changes the mode of the file specified whose pathname is given in pathname, which is dereferenced if it is a sym‐
          bolic link.

       •  fchmod() changes the mode of the file referred to by the open file descriptor fd.

       The new file mode is specified in mode, which is a bit mask created by ORing together zero or more of the following:

       S_ISUID  (04000)  set-user-ID (set process effective user ID on execve(2))

       S_ISGID  (02000)  set-group-ID  (set  process  effective group ID on execve(2); mandatory locking, as described in fcntl(2);
                         take a new file's group from parent directory, as described in chown(2) and mkdir(2))

       S_ISVTX  (01000)  sticky bit (restricted deletion flag, as described in unlink(2))

       S_IRUSR  (00400)  read by owner

       S_IWUSR  (00200)  write by owner

       S_IXUSR  (00100)  execute/search by owner ("search" applies for directories, and means that entries within the directory can
                         be accessed)

       S_IRGRP  (00040)  read by group

       S_IWGRP  (00020)  write by group

       S_IXGRP  (00010)  execute/search by group

       S_IROTH  (00004)  read by others

       S_IWOTH  (00002)  write by others

       S_IXOTH  (00001)  execute/search by others

       The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner of the file, or the process must be privileged (Linux: it must
       have the CAP_FOWNER capability).

       If the calling process is not privileged (Linux: does not have the CAP_FSETID capability), and the group of  the  file  does
       not  match  the effective group ID of the process or one of its supplementary group IDs, the S_ISGID bit will be turned off,
       but this will not cause an error to be returned.

       As a security measure, depending on the filesystem, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID execution bits may be turned off  if  a
       file  is written.  (On Linux, this occurs if the writing process does not have the CAP_FSETID capability.)  On some filesys‐
       tems, only the superuser can set the sticky bit, which may have a special meaning.  For the sticky bit, and for  set-user-ID
       and set-group-ID bits on directories, see inode(7).

       On NFS filesystems, restricting the permissions will immediately influence already open files, because the access control is
       done on the server, but open files are maintained by the client.  Widening the permissions may be delayed for other  clients
       if attribute caching is enabled on them.

   fchmodat()
       The fchmodat() system call operates in exactly the same way as chmod(), except for the differences described here.

       If  the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file de‐
       scriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling process, as is done by  chmod()  for  a
       relative pathname).

       If  pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the current work‐
       ing directory of the calling process (like chmod()).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

       flags can either be 0, or include the following flag:

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
              If pathname is a symbolic link, do not dereference it: instead operate on the link itself.  This  flag  is  not  cur‐
              rently implemented.

       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for fchmodat().

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Depending on the filesystem, errors other than those listed below can be returned.

       The more general errors for chmod() are listed below:

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EBADF  (fchmod()) The file descriptor fd is not valid.

       EBADF  (fchmodat()) pathname is relative but dirfd is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address space.

       EINVAL (fchmodat()) Invalid flag specified in flags.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving pathname.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              pathname is too long.

       ENOENT The file does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       ENOTDIR
              (fchmodat()) pathname is relative and dirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.

       ENOTSUP
              (fchmodat()) flags specified AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, which is not supported.

       EPERM  The  effective  UID  does not match the owner of the file, and the process is not privileged (Linux: it does not have
              the CAP_FOWNER capability).

       EPERM  The file is marked immutable or append-only.  (See ioctl_iflags(2).)

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only filesystem.

VERSIONS
       fchmodat() was added in Linux 2.6.16; library support was added in glibc 2.4.

STANDARDS
       chmod(), fchmod(): 4.4BSD, SVr4, POSIX.1-2001i, POSIX.1-2008.

       fchmodat(): POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
   C library/kernel differences
       The GNU C library fchmodat() wrapper function implements the POSIX-specified interface described in this page.  This  inter‐
       face differs from the underlying Linux system call, which does not have a flags argument.

   glibc notes
       On  older  kernels where fchmodat() is unavailable, the glibc wrapper function falls back to the use of chmod().  When path‐
       name is a relative pathname, glibc constructs a pathname based on the symbolic link in /proc/self/fd that corresponds to the
       dirfd argument.
