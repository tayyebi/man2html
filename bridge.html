OPTIONS
       -V, -Version
              print the version of the bridge utility and exit.

       -s, -stats, -statistics
              output more information. If this option is given multiple times, the amount of information increases.  As a rule, the
              information is statistics or some time values.

       -d, -details
              print detailed information about bridge vlan filter entries or MDB router ports.

       -n, -net, -netns &lt;NETNS&gt;
              switches bridge to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually it just simplifies executing of:

              ip netns exec NETNS bridge [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

              to

              bridge -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       -b, -batch &lt;FILENAME&gt;
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke them.  First failure will cause termination of bridge
              command.

       -force Don't terminate bridge command on errors in batch mode.  If there were any errors during execution of the commands,
              the application return code will be non zero.

       -c[color][={always|auto|never}
              Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always, color output is enabled regardless of stdout state. If pa‐
              rameter is auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color output. If parameter is never, color output
              is disabled. If specified multiple times, the last one takes precedence. This flag is ignored if -json is also given.

       -j, -json
              Output results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

       -p, -pretty
              When combined with -j generate a pretty JSON output.

       -o, -oneline
              output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with the '\' character. This is convenient when you want to
              count records with wc(1) or to grep(1) the output.

BRIDGE - COMMAND SYNTAX
   OBJECT
       link   - Bridge port.

       fdb    - Forwarding Database entry.

       mdb    - Multicast group database entry.

       vlan   - VLAN filter list.

       vni    - VNI filter list.

   COMMAND
       Specifies the action to perform on the object.  The set of possible actions depends on the object type.  As a rule, it is
       possible to add, delete and show (or list ) objects, but some objects do not allow all of these operations or have some ad‐
       ditional commands. The help command is available for all objects. It prints out a list of available commands and argument
       syntax conventions.

       If no command is given, some default command is assumed.  Usually it is list or, if the objects of this class cannot be
       listed, help.

bridge link - bridge port
       link objects correspond to the port devices of the bridge.

       The corresponding commands set and display port status and bridge specific attributes.

   bridge link set - set bridge specific attributes on a port
       dev NAME
              interface name of the bridge port

       cost COST
              the STP path cost of the specified port.

       priority PRIO
              the STP port priority. The priority value is an unsigned 8-bit quantity (number between 0 and 255). This metric is
              used in the designated port an droot port selection algorithms.

       state STATE
              the operation state of the port. Except state 0 (disable STP or BPDU filter feature), this is primarily used by user
              space STP/RSTP implementation. One may enter port state name (case insensitive), or one of the numbers below. Nega‐
              tive inputs are ignored, and unrecognized names return an error.

              0 - port is in STP DISABLED state. Make this port completely inactive for STP. This is also called BPDU filter and
              could be used to disable STP on an untrusted port, like a leaf virtual devices.

              1 - port is in STP LISTENING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. In this state the port listens for
              STP BPDUs and drops all other traffic frames.

              2 - port is in STP LEARNING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. In this state the port will accept
              traffic only for the purpose of updating MAC address tables.

              3 - port is in STP FORWARDING state. Port is fully active.

              4 - port is in STP BLOCKING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. This state is used during the STP
              election process. In this state, port will only process STP BPDUs.

       guard on or guard off
              Controls whether STP BPDUs will be processed by the bridge port. By default, the flag is turned off allowed BPDU pro‐
              cessing. Turning this flag on will disables the bridge port if a STP BPDU packet is received.

              If running Spanning Tree on bridge, hostile devices on the network may send BPDU on a port and cause network failure.
              Setting guard on will detect and stop this by disabling the port.  The port will be restarted if link is brought
              down, or removed and reattached.  For example if guard is enable on eth0:

              ip link set dev eth0 down; ip link set dev eth0 up

       hairpin on or hairpin off
              Controls whether traffic may be send back out of the port on which it was received. This option is also called re‐
              flective relay mode, and is used to support basic VEPA (Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator) capabilities.  By default,
              this flag is turned off and the bridge will not forward traffic back out of the receiving port.

       fastleave on or fastleave off
              This flag allows the bridge to immediately stop multicast traffic on a port that receives IGMP Leave message. It is
              only used with IGMP snooping is enabled on the bridge. By default the flag is off.

       root_block on or root_block off
              Controls whether a given port is allowed to become root port or not. Only used when STP is enabled on the bridge. By
              default the flag is off.

              This feature is also called root port guard.  If BPDU is received from a leaf (edge) port, it should not be elected
              as root port. This could be used if using STP on a bridge and the downstream bridges are not fully trusted; this pre‐
              vents a hostile guest from rerouting traffic.

       learning on or learning off
              Controls whether a given port will learn MAC addresses from received traffic or not. If learning if off, the bridge
              will end up flooding any traffic for which it has no FDB entry. By default this flag is on.

       learning_sync on or learning_sync off
              Controls whether a given port will sync MAC addresses learned on device port to bridge FDB.

       flood on or flood off
              Controls whether unicast traffic for which there is no FDB entry will be flooded towards this given port. By default
              this flag is on.

       hwmode Some network interface cards support HW bridge functionality and they may be configured in different modes. Currently
              support modes are:

              vepa - Data sent between HW ports is sent on the wire to the external switch.

              veb - bridging happens in hardware.

       bcast_flood on or bcast_flood off
              Controls flooding of broadcast traffic on the given port.  By default this flag is on.

       mcast_flood on or mcast_flood off
              Controls whether multicast traffic for which there is no MDB entry will be flooded towards this given port. By de‐
              fault this flag is on.

       mcast_router MULTICAST_ROUTER
              This flag is almost the same as the per-VLAN flag, see below, except its value can only be set in the range 0-2.  The
              default is 1 where the bridge figures out automatically where an IGMP/MLD querier, MRDISC capable device, or PIM
              router, is located.  Setting this flag to 2 is useful in cases where the multicast router does not indicate its pres‐
              ence in any meaningful way (e.g. older versions of SMCRoute, or mrouted), or when there is a need for forwarding both
              known and unknown IP multicast to a secondary/backup router.

       mcast_to_unicast on or mcast_to_unicast off
              Controls whether a given port will replicate packets using unicast instead of multicast. By default this flag is off.

              This is done by copying the packet per host and changing the multicast destination MAC to a unicast one accordingly.

              mcast_to_unicast works on top of the multicast snooping feature of the bridge. Which means unicast copies are only
              delivered to hosts which are interested in it and signalized this via IGMP/MLD reports previously.

              This feature is intended for interface types which have a more reliable and/or efficient way to deliver unicast pack‐
              ets than broadcast ones (e.g. WiFi).

              However, it should only be enabled on interfaces where no IGMPv2/MLDv1 report suppression takes place. IGMP/MLD re‐
              port suppression issue is usually overcome by the network daemon (supplicant) enabling AP isolation and by that sepa‐
              rating all STAs.

              Delivery of STA-to-STA IP multicast is made possible again by enabling and utilizing the bridge hairpin mode, which
              considers the incoming port as a potential outgoing port, too (see hairpin option).  Hairpin mode is performed after
              multicast snooping, therefore leading to only deliver reports to STAs running a multicast router.

       neigh_suppress on or neigh_suppress off
              Controls whether neigh discovery (arp and nd) proxy and suppression is enabled on the port. By default this flag is
              off.

       vlan_tunnel on or vlan_tunnel off
              Controls whether vlan to tunnel mapping is enabled on the port. By default this flag is off.

       isolated on or isolated off
              Controls whether a given port will be isolated, which means it will be able to communicate with non-isolated ports
              only.  By default this flag is off.

       locked on or locked off
              Controls whether a port will be locked, meaning that hosts behind the port will not be able to communicate through
              the port unless an FDB entry with the units MAC address is in the FDB.  The common use is that hosts are allowed ac‐
              cess through authentication with the IEEE 802.1X protocol or based on whitelists or like setups.  By default this
              flag is off.

       backup_port DEVICE
              If the port loses carrier all traffic will be redirected to the configured backup port

       nobackup_port
              Removes the currently configured backup port

       self   link setting is configured on specified physical device

       master link setting is configured on the software bridge (default)

       -t, -timestamp
              display current time when using monitor option.

   bridge link show - list ports configuration for all bridges.
       This command displays port configuration and flags for all bridges.

       To display port configuration and flags for a specific bridge, use the "ip link show master &lt;bridge_device&gt;" command.

bridge fdb - forwarding database management
       fdb objects contain known Ethernet addresses on a link.

       The corresponding commands display fdb entries, add new entries, append entries, and delete old ones.

   bridge fdb add - add a new fdb entry
       This command creates a new fdb entry.

       LLADDR the Ethernet MAC address.

       dev DEV
              the interface to which this address is associated.

              local - is a local permanent fdb entry, which means that the bridge will not forward frames with this destination MAC
              address and VLAN ID, but terminate them locally. This flag is default unless "static" or "dynamic" are explicitly
              specified.

              permanent - this is a synonym for "local"

              static - is a static (no arp) fdb entry

              dynamic - is a dynamic reachable age-able fdb entry

              self - the operation is fulfilled directly by the driver for the specified network device. If the network device be‐
              longs to a master like a bridge, then the bridge is bypassed and not notified of this operation (and if the device
              does notify the bridge, it is driver-specific behavior and not mandated by this flag, check the driver for more de‐
              tails). The "bridge fdb add" command can also be used on the bridge device itself, and in this case, the added fdb
              entries will be locally terminated (not forwarded). In the latter case, the "self" flag is mandatory. The flag is set
              by default if "master" is not specified.

              master - if the specified network device is a port that belongs to a master device such as a bridge, the operation is
              fulfilled by the master device's driver, which may in turn notify the port driver too of the address. If the speci‐
              fied device is a master itself, such as a bridge, this flag is invalid.

              router - the destination address is associated with a router.  Valid if the referenced device is a VXLAN type device
              and has route short circuit enabled.

              use - the address is in use. User space can use this option to indicate to the kernel that the fdb entry is in use.

              extern_learn - this entry was learned externally. This option can be used to indicate to the kernel that an entry was
              hardware or user-space controller learnt dynamic entry. Kernel will not age such an entry.

              sticky - this entry will not change its port due to learning.

      The next command line parameters apply only when the specified device DEV is of type VXLAN.

       dst IPADDR
              the IP address of the destination VXLAN tunnel endpoint where the Ethernet MAC ADDRESS resides.

       src_vni VNI
              the src VNI Network Identifier (or VXLAN Segment ID) this entry belongs to. Used only when the vxlan device is in ex‐
              ternal or collect metadata mode. If omitted the value specified at vxlan device creation will be used.

       vni VNI
              the VXLAN VNI Network Identifier (or VXLAN Segment ID) to use to connect to the remote VXLAN tunnel endpoint.  If
              omitted the value specified at vxlan device creation will be used.

       port PORT
              the UDP destination PORT number to use to connect to the remote VXLAN tunnel endpoint.  If omitted the default value
              is used.

       via DEVICE
              device name of the outgoing interface for the VXLAN device driver to reach the remote VXLAN tunnel endpoint.

       nhid NHID
              ecmp nexthop group for the VXLAN device driver to reach remote VXLAN tunnel endpoints.

   bridge fdb append - append a forwarding database entry
       This command adds a new fdb entry with an already known LLADDR.  Valid only for multicast link layer addresses.  The command
       adds support for broadcast and multicast Ethernet MAC addresses.  The Ethernet MAC address is added multiple times into the
       forwarding database and the vxlan device driver sends a copy of the data packet to each entry found.

       The arguments are the same as with bridge fdb add.

   bridge fdb delete - delete a forwarding database entry
       This command removes an existing fdb entry.

       The arguments are the same as with bridge fdb add.

   bridge fdb replace - replace a forwarding database entry
       If no matching entry is found, a new one will be created instead.

       The arguments are the same as with bridge fdb add.

   bridge fdb show - list forwarding entries.
       This command displays the current forwarding table.

       With the -statistics option, the command becomes verbose. It prints out the last updated and last used time for each entry.

   bridge fdb get - get bridge forwarding entry.
       lookup a bridge forwarding table entry.

       LLADDR the Ethernet MAC address.

       dev DEV
              the interface to which this address is associated.

       brport DEV
              the bridge port to which this address is associated. same as dev above.

       br DEV the bridge to which this address is associated.

       self   - the address is associated with the port drivers fdb. Usually hardware.

       master - the address is associated with master devices fdb. Usually software (default).

   bridge fdb flush - flush bridge forwarding table entries.
       flush the matching bridge forwarding table entries. Some options below have a negated form when "no" is prepended to them
       (e.g. permanent and nopermanent).

       dev DEV
              the target device for the operation. If the device is a bridge port and "master" is set then the operation will be
              fulfilled by its master device's driver and all entries pointing to that port will be deleted.

       brport DEV
              the target bridge port for the operation. If the bridge device is specified then only entries pointing to the bridge
              itself will be deleted. Note that the target device specified by this option will override the one specified by dev
              above.

       vlan VID
              the target VLAN ID for the operation. Match forwarding table entries only with the specified VLAN ID.

       self   the operation is fulfilled directly by the driver for the specified network device. If the network device belongs to
              a master like a bridge, then the bridge is bypassed and not notified of this operation. The "bridge fdb flush" com‐
              mand can also be used on the bridge device itself. The flag is set by default if "master" is not specified.

       master if the specified network device is a port that belongs to a master device such as a bridge, the operation is ful‐
              filled by the master device's driver.

bridge mdb - multicast group database management
       mdb objects contain known IP or L2 multicast group addresses on a link.

       The corresponding commands display mdb entries, add new entries, and delete old ones.

   bridge mdb add - add a new multicast group database entry
       This command creates a new mdb entry.

       dev DEV
              the interface where this group address is associated.

       port PORT
              the port whose link is known to have members of this multicast group.

       grp GROUP
              the multicast group address (IPv4, IPv6 or L2 multicast) whose members reside on the link connected to the port.

              permanent - the mdb entry is permanent. Optional for IPv4 and IPv6, mandatory for L2.

              temp - the mdb entry is temporary (default)

       src SOURCE
              optional source IP address of a sender for this multicast group. If IGMPv3 for IPv4, or MLDv2 for IPv6 respectively,
              are enabled it will be included in the lookup when forwarding multicast traffic.

       vid VID
              the VLAN ID which is known to have members of this multicast group.

   bridge mdb delete - delete a multicast group database entry
       This command removes an existing mdb entry.

       The arguments are the same as with bridge mdb add.

   bridge mdb show - list multicast group database entries
       This command displays the current multicast group membership table. The table is populated by IGMP and MLD snooping in the
       bridge driver automatically. It can be altered by bridge mdb add and bridge mdb del commands manually too.

       dev DEV
              the interface only whose entries should be listed. Default is to list all bridge interfaces.

       With the -details option, the command becomes verbose. It prints out the ports known to have a connected router.

       With the -statistics option, the command displays timer values for mdb and router port entries.

bridge vlan - VLAN filter list
       vlan objects contain known VLAN IDs for a link.

       The corresponding commands display vlan filter entries, add new entries, and delete old ones.

   bridge vlan add - add a new vlan filter entry
       This command creates a new vlan filter entry.

       dev NAME
              the interface with which this vlan is associated.

       vid VID
              the VLAN ID that identifies the vlan.

       tunnel_info TUNNEL_ID
              the TUNNEL ID that maps to this vlan. The tunnel id is set in dst_metadata for every packet that belongs to this vlan
              (applicable to bridge ports with vlan_tunnel flag set).

       pvid   the vlan specified is to be considered a PVID at ingress.  Any untagged frames will be assigned to this VLAN.

       untagged
              the vlan specified is to be treated as untagged on egress.

       self   the vlan is configured on the specified physical device. Required if the device is the bridge device.

       master the vlan is configured on the software bridge (default).

   bridge vlan delete - delete a vlan filter entry
       This command removes an existing vlan filter entry.

       The arguments are the same as with bridge vlan add.  The pvid and untagged flags are ignored.

   bridge vlan set - change vlan filter entry's options
       This command changes vlan filter entry's options.

       dev NAME
              the interface with which this vlan is associated.

       vid VID
              the VLAN ID that identifies the vlan.

       state STP_STATE
              the operation state of the vlan. One may enter STP state name (case insensitive), or one of the numbers below. Nega‐
              tive inputs are ignored, and unrecognized names return an error. Note that the state is set only for the vlan of the
              specified device, e.g. if it is a bridge port then the state will be set only for the vlan of the port.

              0 - vlan is in STP DISABLED state. Make this vlan completely inactive for STP. This is also called BPDU filter and
              could be used to disable STP on an untrusted vlan.

              1 - vlan is in STP LISTENING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. In this state the vlan listens for
              STP BPDUs and drops all other traffic frames.

              2 - vlan is in STP LEARNING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. In this state the vlan will accept
              traffic only for the purpose of updating MAC address tables.

              3 - vlan is in STP FORWARDING state. This is the default vlan state.

              4 - vlan is in STP BLOCKING state. Only valid if STP is enabled on the bridge. This state is used during the STP
              election process. In this state, the vlan will only process STP BPDUs.

       mcast_router MULTICAST_ROUTER
              configure this vlan and interface's multicast router mode, note that only modes 0 - 2 are available for bridge de‐
              vices.  A vlan and interface with a multicast router will receive all multicast traffic.  MULTICAST_ROUTER may be ei‐
              ther

              0 - to disable multicast router.

              1 - to let the system detect the presence of routers (default).

              2 - to permanently enable multicast traffic forwarding on this vlan and interface.

              3 - to temporarily mark this vlan and port as having a multicast router, i.e.  enable multicast traffic forwarding.
              This mode is available only for ports.

   bridge vlan show - list vlan configuration.
       This command displays the current VLAN filter table.

       With the -details option, the command becomes verbose. It displays the per-vlan options.

       With the -statistics option, the command displays per-vlan traffic statistics.

   bridge vlan tunnelshow - list vlan tunnel mapping.
       This command displays the current vlan tunnel info mapping.

   bridge vlan global set - change vlan filter entry's global options
       This command changes vlan filter entry's global options.

       mcast_snooping MULTICAST_SNOOPING
              turn multicast snooping for VLAN entry with VLAN ID on (MULTICAST_SNOOPING &gt; 0) or off (MULTICAST_SNOOPING == 0). De‐
              fault is on.

       mcast_querier MULTICAST_QUERIER
              enable (MULTICAST_QUERIER &gt; 0) or disable (MULTICAST_QUERIER == 0) IGMP/MLD querier, ie sending of multicast queries
              by the bridge. Default is disabled.

       mcast_igmp_version IGMP_VERSION
              set the IGMP version. Default is 2.

       mcast_mld_version MLD_VERSION
              set the MLD version. Default is 1.

       mcast_last_member_count LAST_MEMBER_COUNT
              set multicast last member count, ie the number of queries the bridge will send before stopping forwarding a multicast
              group after a "leave" message has been received. Default is 2.

       mcast_last_member_interval LAST_MEMBER_INTERVAL
              interval between queries to find remaining members of a group, after a "leave" message is received.

       mcast_startup_query_count STARTUP_QUERY_COUNT
              set the number of queries to send during startup phase. Default is 2.

              interval between queries in the startup phase.

       mcast_membership_interval MEMBERSHIP_INTERVAL
              delay after which the bridge will leave a group, if no membership reports for this group are received.

       mcast_querier_interval QUERIER_INTERVAL
              interval between queries sent by other routers. If no queries are seen after this delay has passed, the bridge will
              start to send its own queries (as if mcast_querier was enabled).

       mcast_query_interval QUERY_INTERVAL
              interval between queries sent by the bridge after the end of the startup phase.

       mcast_query_response_interval QUERY_RESPONSE_INTERVAL
              set the Max Response Time/Maximum Response Delay for IGMP/MLD queries sent by the bridge.

   bridge vlan global show - list global vlan options.
       This command displays the global VLAN options for each VLAN entry.

       dev DEV
              the interface only whose VLAN global options should be listed. Default is to list all bridge interfaces.

       vid VID
              the VLAN ID only whose global options should be listed. Default is to list all vlans.

bridge vni - VNI filter list
       vni objects contain known VNI IDs for a dst metadata vxlan link.

       The corresponding commands display vni filter entries, add new entries, and delete old ones.

   bridge vni add - add a new vni filter entry
       This command creates a new vni filter entry.

       dev NAME
              the interface with which this vni is associated.

       vni VNI
              the VNI ID that identifies the vni.

       remote IPADDR
              specifies the unicast destination IP address to use in outgoing packets when the destination link layer address is
              not known in the VXLAN device forwarding database. This parameter cannot be specified with the group.

       group IPADDR
              specifies the multicast IP address to join for this VNI

   bridge vni del - delete a new vni filter entry
       This command removes an existing vni filter entry.

       The arguments are the same as with bridge vni add.

   bridge vni show - list vni filtering configuration.
       This command displays the current vni filter table.

       With the -statistics option, the command displays per-vni traffic statistics.

       dev NAME
              shows vni filtering table associated with the vxlan device

bridge monitor - state monitoring
       The bridge utility can monitor the state of devices and addresses continuously. This option has a slightly different format.
       Namely, the monitor command is the first in the command line and then the object list follows:

       bridge monitor [ all | OBJECT-LIST ]

       OBJECT-LIST is the list of object types that we want to monitor.  It may contain link, fdb, vlan and mdb.  If no file argu‐
       ment is given, bridge opens RTNETLINK, listens on it and dumps state changes in the format described in previous sections.

       If a file name is given, it does not listen on RTNETLINK, but opens the file containing RTNETLINK messages saved in binary
       format and dumps them.

NOTES
       This command uses facilities added in Linux 3.0.

       Although the forwarding table is maintained on a per-bridge device basis the bridge device is not part of the syntax. This
       is a limitation of the underlying netlink neighbour message protocol. When displaying the forwarding table, entries for all
       bridges are displayed.  Add/delete/modify commands determine the underlying bridge device based on the bridge to which the
       corresponding ethernet device is attached.
