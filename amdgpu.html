NAME
       amdgpu - AMD RADEON GPU video driver

SYNOPSIS
       Section "Device"
         Identifier "devname"
         Driver "amdgpu"
         ...
       EndSection

DESCRIPTION
       amdgpu is an Xorg driver for AMD RADEON-based video cards with the following features:

       • Support for 8-, 15-, 16-, 24- and 30-bit pixel depths;
       • RandR support up to version 1.4;
       • 3D acceleration;

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The amdgpu driver supports SI and newer families' video cards.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please  refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to
       this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "SWcursor" "boolean"
              Selects software cursor.  The default is off.

       Option "Accel" "boolean"
              Enables or disables all hardware acceleration.
              The default is on.

       Option "ZaphodHeads" "string"
              Specify the RandR output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particular driver instance.  If you  use  this  option  you
              must use this option for all instances of the driver.
              For  example:  Option  "ZaphodHeads"  "LVDS,VGA-0"  will assign xrandr outputs LVDS and VGA-0 to this instance of the
              driver.

       Option "DRI" "integer"
              Define the maximum level of DRI to enable. Valid values are 2 for DRI2 or 3 for DRI3.  The default is 3 for  DRI3  if
              the Xorg version is &gt;= 1.18.3, otherwise 2 for DRI2.

       Option "EnablePageFlip" "boolean"
              Enable DRI2 page flipping.  The default is on.

       Option "TearFree" "boolean"
              Set  the  default  value  of the per-output 'TearFree' property, which controls tearing prevention using the hardware
              page flipping mechanism. TearFree is on for any CRTC associated with one or more outputs with TearFree on. Two  sepa‐
              rate scanout buffers need to be allocated for each CRTC with TearFree on. If this option is set, the default value of
              the property is 'on' or 'off' accordingly. If this option isn't set, the default value of the property is auto, which
              means that TearFree is on for rotated outputs, outputs with RandR transforms applied and for RandR 1.4 secondary out‐
              puts, otherwise off.

       Option "VariableRefresh" "boolean"
              Enables support for enabling variable refresh on the Screen's CRTCs when an suitable application is flipping via  the
              Present extension.
              The default is off.

       Option "AsyncFlipSecondaries" "boolean"
              Use  async  flips for secondary video outputs on multi-display setups. If a screen has multiple displays attached and
              DRI3 page flipping is used, then only one of the displays will have its page flip synchronized to  vblank  for  tear-
              free  presentation. This is the display that is used for presentation timing and timestamping, usually the one cover‐
              ing the biggest pixel area of the screen.  All other displays ("Secondaries") will not synchronize their flips.  This
              may  cause  some  tearing on these displays, but it prevents a permanent or periodic slowdown or irritating judder of
              animations if not all video outputs are running synchronized with each other and with the same refresh rate. There is
              no  perfect  solution  apart from perfectly synchronized outputs, but this option may give preferrable results if the
              displays in a multi-display setup mirror or clone each other.  The default is off.

       Option "AccelMethod" "string"
              Setting this option to none disables use of the glamor acceleration architecture. In that case, all 2D  rendering  is
              done  by  the  CPU,  but  3D  and video hardware acceleration can still work. This is mainly useful for OpenGL driver
              bring-up.
              The default is to use glamor.

       The following driver Option is supported for glamor :

       Option "ShadowPrimary" "boolean"
              This option enables a so-called "shadow primary" buffer for fast CPU access to pixel data, and separate scanout  buf‐
              fers  for each display controller (CRTC).  This may improve performance for some 2D workloads, potentially at the ex‐
              pense of other (e.g. 3D, video) workloads.  Note in particular that enabling  this  option  currently  disables  page
              flipping.  The default is off.
