NAME
       dpkg-name - rename Debian packages to full package names

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-name [option...]  [--] file...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the dpkg-name program which provides an easy way to rename Debian packages into their full
       package names. A full package name consists of package_version_architecture.package-type as specified in the control file of
       the package. The version part of the filename consists of the upstream version information optionally followed by a hyphen
       and the revision information. The package-type part comes from that field if present or fallbacks to deb.

OPTIONS
       -a, --no-architecture
           The destination filename will not have the architecture information.

       -k, --symlink
           Create a symlink, instead of moving.

       -o, --overwrite
           Existing files will be overwritten if they have the same name as the destination filename.

       -s, --subdir [dir]
           Files will be moved into a subdirectory. If the directory given as argument exists the files will be moved into that
           directory otherwise the name of the target directory is extracted from the section field in the control part of the
           package. The target directory will be «unstable/binary-architecture/section».  If the section is not found in the
           control, then no-section is assumed, and in this case, as well as for sections non-free and contrib the target directory
           is «section/binary-architecture».  The section field is not required so a lot of packages will find their way to the no-
           section area.

           Warning: Use this option with care, it is messy.

       -c, --create-dir
           This option can used together with the -s option. If a target directory isn't found it will be created automatically.

           Warning: Use this option with care.

       -?, --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       -v, --version
           Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_COLORS
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.

       DPKG_NLS
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are: 0 and 1 (default).

BUGS
       Some packages don't follow the name structure package_version_architecture.deb.  Packages renamed by dpkg-name will follow
       this structure. Generally this will have no impact on how packages are installed by dselect(1)/dpkg(1), but other
       installation tools might depend on this naming structure.

EXAMPLES
       dpkg-name bar-foo.deb
           The file bar-foo.deb will be renamed to bar-foo_1.0-2_i386.deb or something similar (depending on whatever information
           is in the control part of bar-foo.deb).

       find /root/debian/ -name '*.deb' | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a
           All files with the extension deb in the directory /root/debian and its subdirectory's will be renamed by dpkg-name if
           required into names with no architecture information.

       find -name '*.deb' | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a -o -s -c
           Don't do this.  Your archive will be messed up completely because a lot of packages don't come with section information.
           Don't do this.

       dpkg-deb --build debian-tmp &amp;&amp; dpkg-name -o -s .. debian-tmp.deb
           This can be used when building new packages.
