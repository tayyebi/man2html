NAME
       binfmt.d - Configure additional binary formats for executables at boot

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/binfmt.d/*.conf

       /run/binfmt.d/*.conf

       /usr/lib/binfmt.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
       At boot, systemd-binfmt.service(8) reads configuration files from the above directories to register in the kernel additional
       binary formats for executables.

CONFIGURATION FORMAT
       Each file contains a list of binfmt_misc kernel binary format rules. Consult the kernel's Kernel Support for miscellaneous
       Binary Formats (binfmt_misc)[1] documentation file for more information on registration of additional binary formats and how
       to write rules.

       Empty lines and lines beginning with ";" and "#" are ignored. Note that this means you may not use those symbols as the
       delimiter in binary format rules.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
       Configuration files are read from directories in /etc/, /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /lib/, in order of precedence, as listed
       in the SYNOPSIS section above. Files must have the ".conf" extension. Files in /etc/ override files with the same name in
       /run/, /usr/local/lib/, and /lib/. Files in /run/ override files with the same name under /usr/.

       All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they
       reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take
       precedence. Thus, the configuration in a certain file may either be replaced completely (by placing a file with the same
       name in a directory with higher priority), or individual settings might be changed (by specifying additional settings in a
       file with a different name that is ordered later).

       Packages should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/ (distribution packages) or /usr/local/lib/ (local installs).
       Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. It is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the
       ordering of the files.

       If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink
       to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file. If the vendor
       configuration file is included in the initrd image, the image has to be regenerated.

EXAMPLE
       Example 1. /etc/binfmt.d/wine.conf example:

           # Start WINE on Windows executables
           :DOSWin:M::MZ::/usr/bin/wine:
