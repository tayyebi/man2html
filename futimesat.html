<pre>futimesat(2)                                            System Calls Manual                                            futimesat(2)

NAME
       futimesat - change timestamps of a file relative to a directory file descriptor

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;            /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

       [[deprecated]] int futimesat(int dirfd, const char *pathname,
                                    const struct timeval times[2]);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       futimesat():
           _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       This system call is obsolete.  Use utimensat(2) instead.

       The futimesat() system call operates in exactly the same way as utimes(2), except for the differences described in this man‐
       ual page.

       If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file  de‐
       scriptor  dirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling process, as is done by utimes(2) for a
       relative pathname).

       If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the current  work‐
       ing directory of the calling process (like utimes(2)).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.  (See openat(2) for an explanation of why the dirfd argument is useful.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, futimesat() returns a 0.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  same errors that occur for utimes(2) can also occur for futimesat().  The following additional errors can occur for fu‐
       timesat():

       EBADF  pathname is relative but dirfd is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor.

       ENOTDIR
              pathname is relative and dirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.

VERSIONS
       futimesat() was added in Linux 2.6.16; library support was added in glibc 2.4.

STANDARDS
       This system call is nonstandard.  It was implemented from a specification that was proposed for POSIX.1, but that specifica‐
       tion was replaced by the one for utimensat(2).

       A similar system call exists on Solaris.

NOTES
   glibc notes
       If pathname is NULL, then the glibc futimesat() wrapper function updates the times for the file referred to by dirfd.
