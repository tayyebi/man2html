<pre>getrusage(2)                                            System Calls Manual                                            getrusage(2)

NAME
       getrusage - get resource usage

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;

       int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *usage);

DESCRIPTION
       getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the following:

       RUSAGE_SELF
              Return  resource  usage  statistics for the calling process, which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the
              process.

       RUSAGE_CHILDREN
              Return resource usage statistics for all children of the calling process that have terminated and  been  waited  for.
              These statistics will include the resources used by grandchildren, and further removed descendants, if all of the in‐
              tervening descendants waited on their terminated children.

       RUSAGE_THREAD (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return resource usage statistics for the calling thread.  The _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro must be defined  (before
              including any header file) in order to obtain the definition of this constant from &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;.

       The resource usages are returned in the structure pointed to by usage, which has the following form:

           struct rusage {
               struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
               struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
               long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */
               long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */
               long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */
               long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */
               long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims (soft page faults) */
               long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults (hard page faults) */
               long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */
               long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */
               long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */
               long   ru_msgsnd;        /* IPC messages sent */
               long   ru_msgrcv;        /* IPC messages received */
               long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */
               long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */
               long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */
           };

       Not  all fields are completed; unmaintained fields are set to zero by the kernel.  (The unmaintained fields are provided for
       compatibility with other systems, and because they may one day be supported on Linux.)  The fields are interpreted  as  fol‐
       lows:

       ru_utime
              This  is  the  total  amount of time spent executing in user mode, expressed in a timeval structure (seconds plus mi‐
              croseconds).

       ru_stime
              This is the total amount of time spent executing in kernel mode, expressed in a timeval structure (seconds  plus  mi‐
              croseconds).

       ru_maxrss (since Linux 2.6.32)
              This is the maximum resident set size used (in kilobytes).  For RUSAGE_CHILDREN, this is the resident set size of the
              largest child, not the maximum resident set size of the process tree.

       ru_ixrss (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       ru_idrss (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       ru_isrss (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       ru_minflt
              The number of page faults serviced without any I/O activity; here I/O activity is  avoided  by  “reclaiming”  a  page
              frame from the list of pages awaiting reallocation.

       ru_majflt
              The number of page faults serviced that required I/O activity.

       ru_nswap (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       ru_inblock (since Linux 2.6.22)
              The number of times the filesystem had to perform input.

       ru_oublock (since Linux 2.6.22)
              The number of times the filesystem had to perform output.

       ru_msgsnd (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       ru_msgrcv (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       ru_nsignals (unmaintained)
              This field is currently unused on Linux.

       ru_nvcsw (since Linux 2.6)
              The  number  of  times a context switch resulted due to a process voluntarily giving up the processor before its time
              slice was completed (usually to await availability of a resource).

       ru_nivcsw (since Linux 2.6)
              The number of times a context switch resulted due to a higher priority process becoming runnable or because the  cur‐
              rent process exceeded its time slice.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT usage points outside the accessible address space.

       EINVAL who is invalid.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001,  POSIX.1-2008,  SVr4,  4.3BSD.   POSIX.1  specifies  getrusage(),  but  specifies only the fields ru_utime and
       ru_stime.

       RUSAGE_THREAD is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Resource usage metrics are preserved across an execve(2).

       Before Linux 2.6.9, if the disposition of SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN then the resource usages of child processes are automat‐
       ically  included in the value returned by RUSAGE_CHILDREN, although POSIX.1-2001 explicitly prohibits this.  This nonconfor‐
       mance is rectified in Linux 2.6.9 and later.

       The structure definition shown at the start of this page was taken from 4.3BSD Reno.

       Ancient systems provided a vtimes() function with a similar purpose to getrusage().  For backward compatibility,  glibc  (up
       until  Linux  2.32)  also  provides vtimes().  All new applications should be written using getrusage().  (Since Linux 2.33,
       glibc no longer provides an vtimes() implementation.)

       See also the description of /proc/pid/stat in proc(5).
