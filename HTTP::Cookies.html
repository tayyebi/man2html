NAME
       HTTP::Cookies - HTTP cookie jars

VERSION
       version 6.10

SYNOPSIS
         use HTTP::Cookies;
         $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new(
           file =&gt; "$ENV{'HOME'}/lwp_cookies.dat",
           autosave =&gt; 1,
         );

         use LWP;
         my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
         $browser-&gt;cookie_jar($cookie_jar);

       Or for an empty and temporary cookie jar:

         use LWP;
         my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
         $browser-&gt;cookie_jar( {} );

DESCRIPTION
       This class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is, a database of all the HTTP cookies that a given
       LWP::UserAgent object knows about.

       Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both store and retrieve information on the client
       side of the connection.  For more information about cookies refer to Cookie Spec &lt;http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html&gt;
       and Cookie Central &lt;http://www.cookiecentral.com&gt;.  This module also implements the new style cookies described in RFC 2965
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965&gt;.  The two variants of cookies are supposed to be able to coexist happily.

       Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to
       use this information to initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects.  The state of a HTTP::Cookies object can be
       saved in and restored from files.

LIMITATIONS
       This module does not support Public Suffix &lt;https://publicsuffix.org/&gt; encouraged by a more recent standard, RFC 6265
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265&gt;.

       This module's shortcomings mean that a malicious Web site can set cookies to track your user agent across all sites under a
       top level domain.  See t/publicsuffix.t in this module's distribution for details.

       HTTP::CookieJar::LWP supports Public Suffix, but only provides a limited subset of this module's functionality and does not
       support standards older than RFC 6265.

METHODS
       The following methods are provided:

       $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies-&gt;new
           The constructor takes hash style parameters.  The following parameters are recognized:

             file:            name of the file to restore cookies from and save cookies to
             autosave:        save during destruction (bool)
             ignore_discard:  save even cookies that are requested to be discarded (bool)
             hide_cookie2:    do not add Cookie2 header to requests

           Future parameters might include (not yet implemented):

             max_cookies               300
             max_cookies_per_domain    20
             max_cookie_size           4096

             no_cookies   list of domain names that we never return cookies to

       $cookie_jar-&gt;get_cookies( $url_or_domain )
       $cookie_jar-&gt;get_cookies( $url_or_domain, $cookie_key,... )
           Returns a hash of the cookies that applies to the given URL. If a domainname is given as argument, then a prefix of
           "https://" is assumed.

           If one or more $cookie_key parameters are provided return the given values, or "undef" if the cookie isn't available.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;add_cookie_header( $request )
           The add_cookie_header() method will set the appropriate Cookie:-header for the HTTP::Request object given as argument.
           The $request must have a valid url attribute before this method is called.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;extract_cookies( $response )
           The extract_cookies() method will look for Set-Cookie: and Set-Cookie2: headers in the HTTP::Response object passed as
           argument.  Any of these headers that are found are used to update the state of the $cookie_jar.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;set_cookie( $version, $key, $val, $path, $domain, $port, $path_spec, $secure, $maxage, $discard, \%rest )
           The set_cookie() method updates the state of the $cookie_jar.  The $key, $val, $domain, $port and $path arguments are
           strings.  The $path_spec, $secure, $discard arguments are boolean values. The $maxage value is a number indicating
           number of seconds that this cookie will live.  A value of $maxage &lt;= 0 will delete this cookie.  The $version argument
           sets the version of the cookie; the default value is 0 ( original Netscape spec ).  Setting $version to another value
           indicates the RFC to which the cookie conforms (e.g. version 1 for RFC 2109).  %rest defines various other attributes
           like "Comment" and "CommentURL".

       $cookie_jar-&gt;save
       $cookie_jar-&gt;save( $file )
       $cookie_jar-&gt;save( file =&gt; $file, ignore_discard =&gt; $ignore_discard )
           This method file saves the state of the $cookie_jar to a file.  The state can then be restored later using the load()
           method.  If a filename is not specified we will use the name specified during construction.  If the $ignore_discard
           value is true (or not specified, but attribute ignore_discard was set at cookie jar construction), then we will even
           save cookies that are marked to be discarded.

           The default is to save a sequence of "Set-Cookie3" lines.  "Set-Cookie3" is a proprietary LWP format, not known to be
           compatible with any browser.  The HTTP::Cookies::Netscape sub-class can be used to save in a format compatible with
           Netscape.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;load
       $cookie_jar-&gt;load( $file )
           This method reads the cookies from the file and adds them to the $cookie_jar.  The file must be in the format written by
           the save() method.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;revert
           This method empties the $cookie_jar and re-loads the $cookie_jar from the last save file.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;clear
       $cookie_jar-&gt;clear( $domain )
       $cookie_jar-&gt;clear( $domain, $path )
       $cookie_jar-&gt;clear( $domain, $path, $key )
           Invoking this method without arguments will empty the whole $cookie_jar.  If given a single argument only cookies
           belonging to that domain will be removed.  If given two arguments, cookies belonging to the specified path within that
           domain are removed.  If given three arguments, then the cookie with the specified key, path and domain is removed.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;clear_temporary_cookies
           Discard all temporary cookies. Scans for all cookies in the jar with either no expire field or a true "discard" flag. To
           be called when the user agent shuts down according to RFC 2965.

       $cookie_jar-&gt;scan( \&amp;callback )
           The argument is a subroutine that will be invoked for each cookie stored in the $cookie_jar.  The subroutine will be
           invoked with the following arguments:

             0  version
             1  key
             2  val
             3  path
             4  domain
             5  port
             6  path_spec
             7  secure
             8  expires
             9  discard
            10  hash

       $cookie_jar-&gt;as_string
       $cookie_jar-&gt;as_string( $skip_discardables )
           The as_string() method will return the state of the $cookie_jar represented as a sequence of "Set-Cookie3" header lines
           separated by "\n".  If $skip_discardables is TRUE, it will not return lines for cookies with the Discard attribute.
