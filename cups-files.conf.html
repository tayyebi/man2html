<pre>cups-files.conf(5)                                          OpenPrinting                                         cups-files.conf(5)

NAME
       cups-files.conf - file and directory configuration file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The  cups-files.conf file configures the files and directories used by the CUPS scheduler, cupsd(8).  It is normally located
       in the /etc/cups directory.

       Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment.  Configuration directives typically con‐
       sist of a name and zero or more values separated by whitespace.  The configuration directive name and values are case-insen‐
       sitive.  Comment lines start with the # character.

   DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood by cupsd(8):

       AccessLog

       AccessLog filename

       AccessLog stderr

       AccessLog syslog
            Defines the access log filename.  Specifying a blank filename disables  access  log  generation.   The  value  "stderr"
            causes  log  entries  to  be sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is running in the foreground, or to the
            system log daemon when run in the background.  The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent to the system log  dae‐
            mon.  The server name may be included in filenames using the string "%s", for example:

                AccessLog /var/log/cups/%s-access_log

            The default is "/var/log/cups/access_log".

       CacheDir directory
            Specifies  the  directory  to  use  for  long-lived temporary (cache) files.  The default is "/var/spool/cups/cache" or
            "/var/cache/cups" depending on the platform.

       ConfigFilePerm mode
            Specifies the permissions for all configuration files that the scheduler writes.  The default is "0644"  on  macOS  and
            "0640" on all other operating systems.

       Note:  The  permissions  for the printers.conf file are currently masked to only allow access from the scheduler user (typi‐
       cally root).  This is done because printer device URIs sometimes contain sensitive authentication  information  that  should
       not be generally known on the system.  There is no way to disable this security feature.

       CreateSelfSignedCerts yes

       CreateSelfSignedCerts no
            Specifies  whether  the scheduler automatically creates self-signed certificates for client connections using TLS.  The
            default is yes.

       DataDir path
            Specifies the directory where data files can be found.  The default is usually "/usr/share/cups".

       DocumentRoot directory
            Specifies the root directory for the CUPS web interface content.  The default is usually "/usr/share/doc/cups".

       ErrorLog

       ErrorLog filename

       ErrorLog stderr

       ErrorLog syslog
            Defines the error log filename.  Specifying a blank filename disables error log generation.  The value "stderr"  causes
            log entries to be sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is running in the foreground, or to the system log
            daemon when run in the background.  The value "syslog" causes log entries to be sent to the  system  log  daemon.   The
            server name may be included in filenames using the string "%s", for example:

                ErrorLog /var/log/cups/%s-error_log

            The default is "/var/log/cups/error_log".

       FatalErrors none

       FatalErrors all -kind [ ... -kind ]

       FatalErrors kind [ ... kind ]
            Specifies which errors are fatal, causing the scheduler to exit.  The default is "config".  The kind strings are:

            none No errors are fatal.

            all  All of the errors below are fatal.

            browse
                 Browsing initialization errors are fatal, for example failed connections to the DNS-SD daemon.

            config
                 Configuration file syntax errors are fatal.

            listen
                 Listen or Port errors are fatal, except for IPv6 failures on the loopback or "any" addresses.

            log  Log file creation or write errors are fatal.

            permissions
                 Bad  startup  file permissions are fatal, for example shared TLS certificate and key files with world-read permis‐
                 sions.

       Group group-name-or-number
            Specifies the group name or ID that will be used when executing external programs.  The default group is operating sys‐
            tem specific but is usually "lp" or "nobody".

       LogFileGroup group-name-or-number
            Specifies  the group name or ID that will be used for log files.  The default group is operating system specific but is
            usually "lp" or "nobody".

       LogFilePerm mode
            Specifies the permissions of all log files that the scheduler writes.  The default is "0644".

       PageLog [ filename ]

       PageLog stderr

       PageLog syslog
            Defines the page log filename.  The value "stderr" causes log entries to be sent to the standard error  file  when  the
            scheduler  is  running  in  the foreground, or to the system log daemon when run in the background.  The value "syslog"
            causes log entries to be sent to the system log daemon.  Specifying a blank filename disables page log generation.  The
            server name may be included in filenames using the string "%s", for example:

                PageLog /var/log/cups/%s-page_log

            The default is "/var/log/cups/page_log".

       PassEnv variable [ ... variable ]
            Passes  the  specified environment variable(s) to child processes.  Note: the standard CUPS filter and backend environ‐
            ment variables cannot be overridden using this directive.

       RemoteRoot username
            Specifies the username that is associated with unauthenticated accesses by clients claiming to be the root  user.   The
            default is "remroot".

       RequestRoot directory
            Specifies the directory that contains print jobs and other HTTP request data.  The default is "/var/spool/cups".

       Sandboxing relaxed

       Sandboxing strict
            Specifies the level of security sandboxing that is applied to print filters, backends, and other child processes of the
            scheduler.  The default is "strict".  This directive is currently only used/supported on macOS.

       ServerBin directory
            Specifies the directory containing the backends, CGI programs, filters, helper programs, notifiers, and port  monitors.
            The default is "/usr/lib/cups" or "/usr/libexec/cups" depending on the platform.

       ServerKeychain path
            Specifies  the  location  of TLS certificates and private keys.  The default is "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" on
            macOS and "/etc/cups/ssl" on all other operating systems.  macOS uses its keychain database to store  certificates  and
            keys  while other platforms use separate files in the specified directory, *.crt for PEM-encoded certificates and *.key
            for PEM-encoded private keys.

       ServerRoot directory
            Specifies the directory containing the server configuration files.  The default is "/etc/cups".

       SetEnv variable value
            Set the specified environment variable to be passed to child processes.  Note: the standard CUPS filter and backend en‐
            vironment variables cannot be overridden using this directive.

       StateDir directory
            Specifies  the directory to use for PID and local certificate files.  The default is "/var/run/cups" or "/etc/cups" de‐
            pending on the platform.

       SyncOnClose Yes

       SyncOnClose No
            Specifies whether the scheduler calls fsync(2) after writing configuration or state files.

       SystemGroup group-name [ ... group-name ]
            Specifies the group(s) to use for @SYSTEM group authentication.   The  default  contains  "admin",  "lpadmin",  "root",
            "sys", and/or "system".

       TempDir directory
            Specifies the directory where short-term temporary files are stored.  The default is "/var/spool/cups/tmp".

       User username
            Specifies the user name or ID that is used when running external programs.  The default is "lp".

   DEPRECATED DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CUPS:

       FileDevice Yes

       FileDevice No
            Specifies  whether the file pseudo-device can be used for new printer queues.  The URI "file:///dev/null" is always al‐
            lowed.  File devices cannot be used with "raw" print queues - a PPD file is required.  The specified file is  overwrit‐
            ten for every print job.  Writing to directories is not supported.

       Printcap filename
            Specifies a file that is filled with a list of local print queues.

       PrintcapFormat bsd

       PrintcapFormat plist

       PrintcapFormat solaris
            Specifies  the  format to use for the Printcap file.  "bsd" is the historical LPD printcap file format.  "plist" is the
            Apple plist file format.  "solaris" is the historical Solaris LPD printcap file format.

NOTES
       The scheduler MUST be restarted manually after making changes to the cups-files.conf file.  On Linux this is typically  done
       using the systemctl(8) command, while on macOS the launchctl(8) command is used instead.
