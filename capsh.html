<pre>CAPSH(1)                                                   User Commands                                                   CAPSH(1)

NAME
       capsh - capability shell wrapper

SYNOPSIS
       capsh [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Linux capability support and use can be explored and constrained with this tool. This tool provides a handy wrapper for cer‐
       tain types of capability testing and environment creation. It also provides some debugging features useful  for  summarizing
       capability state.

OPTIONS
       capsh takes a number of optional arguments, acting on them in the order they are provided. They are as follows:

       --help Display the list of commands supported by capsh.

       --print
              Display prevailing capability and related state.

       --current
              Display prevailing capability state, 1e capabilities and IAB vector.

       -- [args]
              Execute /bin/bash with trailing arguments. Note, you can use -c 'command to execute' for specific commands.

       -+ [args]
              Uses  cap_launch(3)  to  fork  a child to execute the shell. When the child exits, capsh exits with the status of the
              child or 1 in the case that the child was terminated by a signal.

       == [args]
              Execute capsh again with the remaining arguments. Useful for testing exec() behavior. Note, PATH is searched when the
              running  capsh  was found via the shell's PATH searching. If the exec occurs after a --chroot=/some/path argument the
              PATH located binary may not be resolve to the same binary as that running initially. This  behavior  is  an  intended
              feature as it can complete the chroot transition.

       =+ [args]
              Uses  cap_launch(3)  to  fork  a child to re-execute capsh. When this child exits, capsh exits with the status of the
              child or 1 in the case that the child was terminated by a signal.

       --caps=cap-set
              Set the prevailing process capabilities to those specified by cap-set.  Where cap-set is a text-representation of ca‐
              pability state as per cap_from_text(3).

       --drop=cap-list
              Remove the listed capabilities from the prevailing bounding set. The capabilities are a comma-separated list of capa‐
              bilities as recognized by the cap_from_name(3) function. Use of this feature requires that capsh  is  operating  with
              CAP_SETPCAP in its effective set.

       --inh=cap-list
              Set  the inheritable set of capabilities for the current process to equal those provided in the comma separated list.
              For this action to succeed, the prevailing process should already have each of these capabilities in the union of the
              current  inheritable  and  permitted  capability sets, or capsh should be operating with CAP_SETPCAP in its effective
              set.

       --user=username
              Assume the identity of the named user. That is, look up the user's UID and GID with getpwuid(3) and their group  mem‐
              berships with getgrouplist(3) and set them all using cap_setuid(3) and cap_setgroups(3).  Following this command, the
              effective capabilities will be cleared, but the permitted set will not be, so the running  program  is  still  privi‐
              leged.

       --mode Display the prevailing libcap mode as guessed by the cap_get_mode(3) function.

       --mode=&lt;mode&gt;
              Force  the  program  into  a cap_set_mode(3) security mode. This is a set of securebits and prevailing capability ar‐
              rangement recommended for its pre-determined security stance.

       --modes
              Lists all of the libcap modes supported by --mode=&lt;mode&gt;.

       --inmode=&lt;mode&gt;
              Confirm that the prevailing mode is that specified in &lt;mode&gt;, or exit with a status 1.

       --uid=id
              Force all UID values to equal id using the setuid(2) system call. This argument may require explicit  preparation  of
              the effective set.

       --cap-uid=&lt;uid&gt;
              use  the cap_setuid(3) function to set the UID of the current process. This performs all preparations for setting the
              UID without dropping capabilities in the process. Following this command the prevailing effective  capabilities  will
              be lowered.

       --is-uid=&lt;id&gt;
              Exit with status 1 unless the current UID equals &lt;id&gt;.

       --gid=&lt;id&gt;
              Force all GID values to equal id using the setgid(2) system call.

       --is-gid=&lt;id&gt;
              Exit with status 1 unless the current GIQ equals &lt;id&gt;.

       --groups=&lt;gid-list&gt;
              Set  the  supplementary  groups to the numerical list provided. The groups are set with the setgroups(2) system call.
              See --user for a more convenient way of doing this.

       --keep=&lt;0|1&gt;
              In a non-pure capability mode, the kernel provides liberal privilege to the super-user. However, it is  normally  the
              case  that  when the super-user changes UID to some lesser user, then capabilities are dropped. For these situations,
              the kernel can permit the process to retain its capabilities after a setuid(2) system call. This feature is known  as
              keep-caps support. The way to activate it using this program is with this argument. Setting the value to 1 will cause
              keep-caps to be active. Setting it to 0 will cause keep-caps to deactivate for the current  process.  In  all  cases,
              keep-caps is deactivated when an exec() is performed. See --secbitsand--mode for ways to disable this feature.

       --secbits=N
              Set  the  security-bits  for  the program.  This is done using the prctl(2) PR_SET_SECUREBITS operation.  The list of
              supported bits and their meaning can be found in the &lt;sys/secbits.h&gt; header file. The program will  list  these  bits
              via  the  --print  command.   The argument is expressed as a numeric bitmask, in any of the formats permitted by str‐
              toul(3).  An alternative to this bit-twiddling is embedded in the --mode* commandline arguments.

       --chroot=/some/path
              Execute the chroot(2) system call with the new root-directory (/) equal to path.  This operation requires CAP_SYS_CH‐
              ROOT to be in effect.

       --forkfor=sec
              This  command causes the program to fork a child process for so many seconds. The child will sleep that long and then
              exit with status 0. The purpose of this command is to support exploring the way processes are killable in the face of
              capability changes. See the --killit command. Only one fork can be active at a time.

       --killit=sig
              This commands causes a --forkfor child to be kill(2)d with the specified signal. The command then waits for the child
              to exit.  If the exit status does not match the signal being used to kill it, the capsh program exits with status 1.

       --explain=cap_xxx
              Give a brief textual description of what privileges the specified capability makes available to  a  running  program.
              Note,  instead of cap_xxx, one can provide a decimal number and capsh will look up the corresponding capability's de‐
              scription.

       --shell=/full/path
              This option changes the shell that is invoked when the argument == is encountered.

       --strict
              This option toggles the suppression of subsequent attempts to fixup --caps= and --inh= arguments. That is,  when  the
              prevailing  Effective flag does not contain CAP_SETPCAP the to be raised Inheritable Flag values (in strict mode) are
              limited to those in the Permitted set. The strict mode defaults to off. Supplying this argument  an  even  number  of
              times restores this default behavior.

       --suggest=phrase
              Scan  each  of  the  textual  descriptions of capabilities, known to capsh, and display all descriptions that include
              phrase.

       --decode=N
              This is a convenience feature. If you look at /proc/1/status there are some capability related fields of the  follow‐
              ing form:

              CapInh:   0000000000000000
              CapPrm:   0000003fffffffff
              CapEff:   0000003fffffffff
              CapBnd:   0000003fffffffff
              CapAmb:   0000000000000000

              This option provides a quick way to decode a capability vector represented in this hexadecimal form.  Here's an exam‐
              ple that decodes the two lowest capability bits:

              $ capsh --decode=3
              0x0000000000000003=cap_chown,cap_dac_override

       --supports=xxx
              As the kernel evolves, more capabilities are added. This option can be used to verify the existence of  a  capability
              on  the  system.  For example, --supports=cap_syslog will cause capsh to promptly exit with a status of 1 when run on
              kernel 2.6.27.  However, when run on kernel 2.6.38 it will silently succeed.

       --has-p=xxx
              Exit with status 1 unless the permitted vector has capability xxx raised.

       --has-ambient
              Performs a check to see if the running kernel supports ambient capabilities. If not, capsh exits with status 1.

       --has-a=xxx
              Exit with status 1 unless the ambient vector has capability xxx raised.

       --has-b=xxx
              Exit with status 1 unless the bounding vector has capability xxx in its (default) non-blocked state.

       --iab=xxx
              Attempts to set the IAB tuple of inheritable capability vectors.  The text conventions used  for  xxx  are  those  of
              cap_iab_from_text(3).

       --addamb=xxx
              Adds the specified ambient capability to the running process.

       --delamb=xxx
              Removes the specified ambient capability from the running process.

       --noamb
              Drops all ambient capabilities from the running process.

       --noenv
              Suppresses overriding of the HOME and USER environment variables when a subsequent --user argument is processed.

       --quiet
              This argument is ignored unless it is the first one. If present, it suppresses the capsh runtime check to confirm the
              running libcap is recent enough that it can name all of the kernel supported capability values.

EXIT STATUS
       Following successful execution, capsh exits with status 0. Following an error, capsh immediately exits with status 1.
