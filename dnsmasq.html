<pre>DNSMASQ(8)                                            System Manager's Manual                                            DNSMASQ(8)

NAME
       dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server.

SYNOPSIS
       dnsmasq [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       dnsmasq  is  a  lightweight  DNS, TFTP, PXE, router advertisement and DHCP server. It is intended to provide coupled DNS and
       DHCP service to a LAN.

       Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local, cache or forwards them to a  real,  recursive,  DNS
       server.  It  loads  the contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved
       and also answers DNS queries for DHCP configured hosts. It can also act as the authoritative DNS server for one or more  do‐
       mains, allowing local names to appear in the global DNS. It can be configured to do DNSSEC validation.

       The dnsmasq DHCP server supports static address assignments and multiple networks. It automatically sends a sensible default
       set of DHCP options, and can be configured to send any desired set of DHCP options, including  vendor-encapsulated  options.
       It includes a secure, read-only, TFTP server to allow net/PXE boot of DHCP hosts and also supports BOOTP. The PXE support is
       full featured, and includes a proxy mode which supplies PXE information to clients whilst DHCP address allocation is done by
       another server.

       The dnsmasq DHCPv6 server provides the same set of features as the DHCPv4 server, and in addition, it includes router adver‐
       tisements and a neat feature which allows naming for clients which use DHCPv4 and stateless autoconfiguration only for  IPv6
       configuration.  There  is support for doing address allocation (both DHCPv6 and RA) from subnets which are dynamically dele‐
       gated via DHCPv6 prefix delegation.

       Dnsmasq is coded with small embedded systems in mind. It aims for the smallest possible memory footprint compatible with the
       supported functions,  and allows unneeded functions to be omitted from the compiled binary.

OPTIONS
       Note  that  in general missing parameters are allowed and switch off functions, for instance "--pid-file" disables writing a
       PID file. On BSD, unless the GNU getopt library is linked, the long form of the options does not work on the  command  line;
       it is still recognised in the configuration file.

       --test Read  and  syntax  check  configuration  file(s). Exit with code 0 if all is OK, or a non-zero code otherwise. Do not
              start up dnsmasq.

       -w, --help
              Display all command-line options.  --help dhcp will display known DHCPv4 configuration options, and --help dhcp6 will
              display DHCPv6 options.

       -h, --no-hosts
              Don't read the hostnames in /etc/hosts.

       -H, --addn-hosts=&lt;file&gt;
              Additional hosts file. Read the specified file as well as /etc/hosts. If --no-hosts is given, read only the specified
              file. This option may be repeated for more than one additional hosts file. If a directory is given, then read all the
              files contained in that directory in alphabetical order.

       --hostsdir=&lt;path&gt;
              Read  all  the  hosts  files contained in the directory. New or changed files are read automatically and modified and
              deleted files have removed records automatically deleted.

       -E, --expand-hosts
              Add the domain to simple names (without a period) in /etc/hosts in the same way as for DHCP-derived names. Note  that
              this does not apply to domain names in cnames, PTR records, TXT records etc.

       -T, --local-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
              When  replying  with information from /etc/hosts or configuration or the DHCP leases file dnsmasq by default sets the
              time-to-live field to zero, meaning that the requester should not itself cache the information. This is  the  correct
              thing  to  do in almost all situations. This option allows a time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for these replies.
              This will reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients using stale data under some circumstances.

       --dhcp-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
              As for --local-ttl, but affects only replies with information from DHCP leases. If both are given, --dhcp-ttl applies
              for DHCP information, and --local-ttl for others. Setting this to zero eliminates the effect of --local-ttl for DHCP.

       --neg-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
              Negative  replies  from  upstream servers normally contain time-to-live information in SOA records which dnsmasq uses
              for caching. If the replies from upstream servers omit this information, dnsmasq does not cache the reply.  This  op‐
              tion gives a default value for time-to-live (in seconds) which dnsmasq uses to cache negative replies even in the ab‐
              sence of an SOA record.

       --max-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
              Set a maximum TTL value that will be handed out to clients. The specified maximum TTL will be given  to  clients  in‐
              stead of the true TTL value if it is lower. The true TTL value is however kept in the cache to avoid flooding the up‐
              stream DNS servers.

       --max-cache-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
              Set a maximum TTL value for entries in the cache.

       --min-cache-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
              Extend short TTL values to the time given when caching them. Note that artificially extending TTL values is  in  gen‐
              eral  a  bad idea, do not do it unless you have a good reason, and understand what you are doing.  Dnsmasq limits the
              value of this option to one hour, unless recompiled.

       --auth-ttl=&lt;time&gt;
              Set the TTL value returned in answers from the authoritative server.

       --fast-dns-retry=[&lt;initial retry delay in ms&gt;[,&lt;time to continue retries in ms&gt;]]
              Under normal circumstances, dnsmasq relies on DNS clients to do retries; it does not generate timeouts  itself.  Set‐
              ting  this  option  instructs dnsmasq to generate its own retries starting after a delay which defaults to 1000ms. If
              the second parameter is given this controls how long the  retries  will  continue  for  otherwise  this  defaults  to
              10000ms.  Retries  are  repeated with exponential backoff. Using this option increases memory usage and network band‐
              width.

       -k, --keep-in-foreground
              Do not go into the background at startup but otherwise run as normal. This is intended for use when  dnsmasq  is  run
              under daemontools or launchd.

       -d, --no-daemon
              Debug  mode:  don't  fork  to the background, don't write a pid file, don't change user id, generate a complete cache
              dump on receipt on SIGUSR1, log to stderr as well as syslog, don't fork new processes to  handle  TCP  queries.  Note
              that this option is for use in debugging only, to stop dnsmasq daemonising in production, use --keep-in-foreground.

       -q, --log-queries
              Log  the  results  of DNS queries handled by dnsmasq. Enable a full cache dump on receipt of SIGUSR1. If the argument
              "extra" is supplied, ie --log-queries=extra then the log has extra information at the start of each line.  This  con‐
              sists of a serial number which ties together the log lines associated with an individual query, and the IP address of
              the requestor.

       -8, --log-facility=&lt;facility&gt;
              Set the facility to which dnsmasq will send syslog entries, this defaults to DAEMON, and to LOCAL0 when debug mode is
              in  operation.  If  the facility given contains at least one '/' character, it is taken to be a filename, and dnsmasq
              logs to the given file, instead of syslog. If the facility is '-' then dnsmasq logs to stderr.  (Errors whilst  read‐
              ing  configuration  will still go to syslog, but all output from a successful startup, and all output whilst running,
              will go exclusively to the file.) When logging to a file, dnsmasq will close and reopen the file when it receives SI‐
              GUSR2. This allows the log file to be rotated without stopping dnsmasq.

       --log-debug
              Enable extra logging intended for debugging rather than information.

       --log-async[=&lt;lines&gt;]
              Enable  asynchronous logging and optionally set the limit on the number of lines which will be queued by dnsmasq when
              writing to the syslog is slow.  Dnsmasq can log asynchronously: this allows it to continue functioning without  being
              blocked  by  syslog, and allows syslog to use dnsmasq for DNS queries without risking deadlock.  If the queue of log-
              lines becomes full, dnsmasq will log the overflow, and the number of messages  lost. The default queue length is 5, a
              sane value would be 5-25, and a maximum limit of 100 is imposed.

       -x, --pid-file=&lt;path&gt;
              Specify an alternate path for dnsmasq to record its process-id in. Normally /var/run/dnsmasq.pid.

       -u, --user=&lt;username&gt;
              Specify  the userid to which dnsmasq will change after startup. Dnsmasq must normally be started as root, but it will
              drop root privileges after startup by changing id to another user. Normally this user is "nobody"  but  that  can  be
              over-ridden with this switch.

       -g, --group=&lt;groupname&gt;
              Specify the group which dnsmasq will run as. The default is "dip", if available, to facilitate access to /etc/ppp/re‐
              solv.conf which is not normally world readable.

       -v, --version
              Print the version number.

       -p, --port=&lt;port&gt;
              Listen on &lt;port&gt; instead of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this to zero completely disables DNS function,  leav‐
              ing only DHCP and/or TFTP.

       -P, --edns-packet-max=&lt;size&gt;
              Specify  the  largest  EDNS.0  UDP  packet  which  is  supported by the DNS forwarder. Defaults to 4096, which is the
              RFC5625-recommended size.

       -Q, --query-port=&lt;query_port&gt;
              Send outbound DNS queries from, and listen for their replies on, the specific UDP port &lt;query_port&gt; instead of  using
              random  ports.  NOTE  that using this option will make dnsmasq less secure against DNS spoofing attacks but it may be
              faster and use less resources.  Setting this option to zero makes dnsmasq use a single port allocated to  it  by  the
              OS: this was the default behaviour in versions prior to 2.43.

       --port-limit=&lt;#ports&gt;
              By default, when sending a query via random ports to multiple upstream servers or retrying a query dnsmasq will use a
              single random port for all the tries/retries.  This option allows a larger number of ports to be used, which can  in‐
              crease robustness in certain network configurations. Note that increasing this to more than two or three can have se‐
              curity and resource implications and should only be done with understanding of those.

       --min-port=&lt;port&gt;
              Do not use ports less than that given as source for outbound DNS queries. Dnsmasq picks random ports  as  source  for
              outbound  queries:  when  this  option is given, the ports used will always be larger than that specified. Useful for
              systems behind firewalls. If not specified, defaults to 1024.

       --max-port=&lt;port&gt;
              Use ports lower than that given as source for outbound DNS queries.  Dnsmasq picks random ports as  source  for  out‐
              bound queries: when this option is given, the ports used will always be lower than that specified. Useful for systems
              behind firewalls.

       -i, --interface=&lt;interface name&gt;
              Listen only on the specified interface(s). Dnsmasq automatically adds the loopback (local) interface to the  list  of
              interfaces  to use when the --interface option  is used. If no --interface or --listen-address options are given dns‐
              masq listens on all available interfaces except any given in --except-interface options. On Linux, when --bind-inter‐
              faces  or  --bind-dynamic  are  in effect, IP alias interface labels (eg "eth1:0") are checked, rather than interface
              names. In the degenerate case when an interface has one address, this amounts to the same thing but when an interface
              has  multiple  addresses it allows control over which of those addresses are accepted.  The same effect is achievable
              in default mode by using --listen-address.  A simple wildcard, consisting of a trailing '*', can be used in  --inter‐
              face and --except-interface options.

       -I, --except-interface=&lt;interface name&gt;
              Do  not listen on the specified interface. Note that the order of --listen-address --interface and --except-interface
              options does not matter and that --except-interface options always override the others. The comments about  interface
              labels for --listen-address apply here.

       --auth-server=&lt;domain&gt;,[&lt;interface&gt;|&lt;ip-address&gt;...]
              Enable  DNS  authoritative  mode  for queries arriving at an interface or address. Note that the interface or address
              need not be mentioned in --interface or --listen-address configuration, indeed --auth-server will override these  and
              provide  a  different DNS service on the specified interface. The &lt;domain&gt; is the "glue record". It should resolve in
              the global DNS to an A and/or AAAA record which points to the address dnsmasq is listening on. When an  interface  is
              specified,  it  may be qualified with "/4" or "/6" to specify only the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses associated with the in‐
              terface. Since any defined authoritative zones are also available as part of the normal recusive DNS service supplied
              by dnsmasq, it can make sense to have an --auth-server declaration with no interfaces or address, but simply specify‐
              ing the primary external nameserver.

       --local-service
              Accept DNS queries only from hosts whose address is on a local subnet, ie a subnet for which an interface  exists  on
              the  server. This option only has effect if there are no --interface, --except-interface, --listen-address or --auth-
              server options. It is intended to be set as a default on installation, to allow unconfigured installations to be use‐
              ful but also safe from being used for DNS amplification attacks.

       -2, --no-dhcp-interface=&lt;interface name&gt;
              Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but do provide DNS service.

       -a, --listen-address=&lt;ipaddr&gt;
              Listen on the given IP address(es). Both --interface and --listen-address options may be given, in which case the set
              of both interfaces and addresses is used. Note that if no --interface option is given, but --listen-address is,  dns‐
              masq will not automatically listen on the loopback interface. To achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must be ex‐
              plicitly given as a --listen-address option.

       -z, --bind-interfaces
              On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address, even when it is listening on only  some  interfaces.
              It then discards requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of working even when interfaces come and
              go and change address. This option forces dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening  on.  About  the
              only  time  when  this  is useful is when running another nameserver (or another instance of dnsmasq) on the same ma‐
              chine. Setting this option also enables multiple instances of dnsmasq which provide DHCP service to run in  the  same
              machine.

       --bind-dynamic
              Enable a network mode which is a hybrid between --bind-interfaces and the default. Dnsmasq binds the address of indi‐
              vidual interfaces, allowing multiple dnsmasq instances, but if new interfaces or addresses appear,  it  automatically
              listens on those (subject to any access-control configuration). This makes dynamically created interfaces work in the
              same way as the default. Implementing this option requires non-standard networking APIs and it is only available  un‐
              der Linux. On other platforms it falls-back to --bind-interfaces mode.

       -y, --localise-queries
              Return  answers  to DNS queries from /etc/hosts and --interface-name and --dynamic-host which depend on the interface
              over which the query was received. If a name has more than one address associated with it, and at least one of  those
              addresses  is  on  the  same subnet as the interface to which the query was sent, then return only the address(es) on
              that subnet and return all the available addresses otherwise.  This allows for a server  to have  multiple  addresses
              in  /etc/hosts corresponding to each of its interfaces, and hosts will get the correct address based on which network
              they are attached to. Currently this facility is limited to IPv4.

       -b, --bogus-priv
              Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc) which are not found in
              /etc/hosts  or  the DHCP leases file are answered with "no such domain" rather than being forwarded upstream. The set
              of prefixes affected is the list given in RFC6303, for IPv4 and IPv6.

       -V, --alias=[&lt;old-ip&gt;]|[&lt;start-ip&gt;-&lt;end-ip&gt;],&lt;new-ip&gt;[,&lt;mask&gt;]
              Modify IPv4 addresses returned from upstream nameservers; old-ip is replaced by new-ip. If the optional mask is given
              then    any    address    which    matches    the    masked   old-ip   will   be   re-written.   So,   for   instance
              --alias=1.2.3.0,6.7.8.0,255.255.255.0 will map 1.2.3.56 to 6.7.8.56 and 1.2.3.67 to 6.7.8.67. This is what Cisco  PIX
              routers  call "DNS doctoring". If the old IP is given as range, then only addresses in the range, rather than a whole
              subnet, are re-written. So --alias=192.168.0.10-192.168.0.40,10.0.0.0,255.255.255.0  maps  192.168.0.10-&gt;192.168.0.40
              to 10.0.0.10-&gt;10.0.0.40

       -B, --bogus-nxdomain=&lt;ipaddr&gt;[/prefix]
              Transform replies which contain the specified address or subnet into "No such domain" replies. IPv4 and IPv6 are sup‐
              ported. This is intended to counteract a devious move made by Verisign in September 2003 when they started  returning
              the address of an advertising web page in response to queries for unregistered names, instead of the correct NXDOMAIN
              response. This option tells dnsmasq to fake the correct response when it sees this behaviour. As at Sept 2003 the  IP
              address being returned by Verisign is 64.94.110.11

       --ignore-address=&lt;ipaddr&gt;[/prefix]
              Ignore  replies  to  A or AAAA queries which include the specified address or subnet.  No error is generated, dnsmasq
              simply continues to listen for another reply.  This is useful to defeat blocking strategies  which  rely  on  quickly
              supplying a forged answer to a DNS request for certain domain, before the correct answer can arrive.

       -f, --filterwin2k
              Later  versions  of  windows  make periodic DNS requests which don't get sensible answers from the public DNS and can
              cause problems by triggering dial-on-demand links. This flag turns on an option to filter such requests. The requests
              blocked  are  for  records  of type ANY where the requested name has underscores, to catch LDAP requests, and for all
              records of types SOA and SRV.

       --filter-A
              Remove A records from answers. No IPv4 addresses will be returned.

       --filter-AAAA
              Remove AAAA records from answers. No IPv6 addresses will be returned.

       -r, --resolv-file=&lt;file&gt;
              Read the IP addresses of the upstream nameservers from &lt;file&gt;, instead of /etc/resolv.conf. For the  format  of  this
              file  see  resolv.conf(5).   The only lines relevant to dnsmasq are nameserver ones. Dnsmasq can be told to poll more
              than one resolv.conf file, the first file name  specified overrides the default, subsequent ones  add  to  the  list.
              This is only allowed when polling; the file with the currently latest modification time is the one used.

       -R, --no-resolv
              Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command line or the dnsmasq configuration file.

       -1, --enable-dbus[=&lt;service-name&gt;]
              Allow  dnsmasq  configuration to be updated via DBus method calls. The configuration which can be changed is upstream
              DNS servers (and corresponding domains) and cache clear. Requires that dnsmasq has been built with DBus  support.  If
              the  service  name  is  given, dnsmasq provides service at that name, rather than the default which is uk.org.thekel‐
              leys.dnsmasq

       --enable-ubus[=&lt;service-name&gt;]
              Enable dnsmasq UBus interface. It sends notifications via UBus on DHCPACK and DHCPRELEASE events. Furthermore it  of‐
              fers metrics and allows configuration of Linux connection track mark based filtering.  When DNS query filtering based
              on Linux connection track marks is enabled UBus notifications are generated for each resolved or filtered DNS  query.
              Requires  that  dnsmasq  has  been built with UBus support. If the service name is given, dnsmasq provides service at
              that namespace, rather than the default which is dnsmasq

       -o, --strict-order
              By default, dnsmasq will send queries to any of the upstream servers it knows about and tries to favour servers  that
              are  known  to  be up. Setting this flag forces dnsmasq to try each query with each server strictly in the order they
              appear in /etc/resolv.conf

       --all-servers
              By default, when dnsmasq has more than one upstream server available, it will send queries to just one  server.  Set‐
              ting  this  flag forces dnsmasq to send all queries to all available servers. The reply from the server which answers
              first will be returned to the original requester.

       --dns-loop-detect
              Enable code to detect DNS forwarding loops; ie the situation where a query sent to one of the upstream server eventu‐
              ally  returns  as  a  new  query  to  the  dnsmasq  instance. The process works by generating TXT queries of the form
              &lt;hex&gt;.test and sending them to each upstream server. The hex is a UID which encodes the instance of  dnsmasq  sending
              the  query  and  the upstream server to which it was sent. If the query returns to the server which sent it, then the
              upstream server through which it was sent is disabled and this event is logged. Each time the set of upstream servers
              changes, the test is re-run on all of them, including ones which were previously disabled.

       --stop-dns-rebind
              Reject  (and  log) addresses from upstream nameservers which are in the private ranges. This blocks an attack where a
              browser behind a firewall is used to probe machines on the local network. For IPv6,  the  private  range  covers  the
              IPv4-mapped addresses in private space plus all link-local (LL) and site-local (ULA) addresses.

       --rebind-localhost-ok
              Exempt  127.0.0.0/8  and ::1 from rebinding checks. This address range is returned by realtime black hole servers, so
              blocking it may disable these services.

       --rebind-domain-ok=[&lt;domain&gt;]|[[/&lt;domain&gt;/[&lt;domain&gt;/]
              Do not detect and block dns-rebind on queries to these domains. The argument may be either a single domain, or multi‐
              ple domains surrounded by '/', like the --server syntax, eg.  --rebind-domain-ok=/domain1/domain2/domain3/

       -n, --no-poll
              Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.

       --clear-on-reload
              Whenever  /etc/resolv.conf  is re-read or the upstream servers are set via DBus, clear the DNS cache.  This is useful
              when new nameservers may have different data than that held in cache.

       -D, --domain-needed
              Tells dnsmasq to never forward A or AAAA queries for plain names, without dots or domain  parts,  to  upstream  name‐
              servers. If the name is not known from /etc/hosts or DHCP then a "not found" answer is returned.

       -S, --local, --server=[/[&lt;domain&gt;]/[domain/]][&lt;server&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;]][@&lt;interface&gt;][@&lt;source-ip&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;]]
              Specify  upstream  servers directly. Setting this flag does not suppress reading of /etc/resolv.conf, use --no-resolv
              to do that. If one or more optional domains are given, that server is used  only  for  those  domains  and  they  are
              queried  only  using the specified server. This is intended for private nameservers: if you have a nameserver on your
              network which deals with names of the form  xxx.internal.thekelleys.org.uk  at  192.168.1.1  then  giving   the  flag
              --server=/internal.thekelleys.org.uk/192.168.1.1  will send all queries for internal machines to that nameserver, ev‐
              erything else will go to the servers in /etc/resolv.conf. DNSSEC validation is turned  off  for  such  private  name‐
              servers,  UNLESS  a --trust-anchor is specified for the domain in question. An empty domain specification, // has the
              special meaning of "unqualified names only" ie names without any dots in them. A non-standard port may  be  specified
              as  part  of  the  IP  address  using a # character.  More than one --server flag is allowed, with repeated domain or
              ipaddr parts as required.

              More  specific   domains   take   precedence   over   less   specific   domains,   so:   --server=/google.com/1.2.3.4
              --server=/www.google.com/2.3.4.5 will send queries for google.com and gmail.google.com to 1.2.3.4, but www.google.com
              will go to 2.3.4.5

              Matching of domains is normally done on complete labels, so /google.com/ matches google.com  and  www.google.com  but
              NOT  supergoogle.com.  This  can  be  overridden  with  a  * at the start of a pattern only: /*google.com/ will match
              google.com and www.google.com AND supergoogle.com. The  non-wildcard  form  has  priority,  so  if  /google.com/  and
              /*google.com/  are  both  specified then google.com and www.google.com will match /google.com/ and /*google.com/ will
              only match supergoogle.com.

              For historical reasons, the pattern /.google.com/ is equivalent to /google.com/ if you wish to match any subdomain of
              google.com but NOT google.com itself, use /*.google.com/

              The   special   server   address   '#'   means,   "use   the   standard   servers",  so  --server=/google.com/1.2.3.4
              --server=/www.google.com/# will send queries for google.com and its subdomains to 1.2.3.4, except www.google.com (and
              its subdomains) which will be forwarded as usual.

              Also  permitted is a -S flag which gives a domain but no IP address; this tells dnsmasq that a domain is local and it
              may answer queries from /etc/hosts or DHCP but should never forward queries on that domain to any  upstream  servers.
              --local is a synonym for --server to make configuration files clearer in this case.

              IPv6 addresses may include an %interface scope-id, eg fe80::202:a412:4512:7bbf%eth0.

              The  optional  string after the @ character tells dnsmasq how to set the source of the queries to this nameserver. It
              can either be an ip-address, an interface name or both. The ip-address should belong to the machine on which  dnsmasq
              is  running,  otherwise this server line will be logged and then ignored. If an interface name is given, then queries
              to the server will be forced via that interface; if an ip-address is given then the source  address  of  the  queries
              will  be  set to that address; and if both are given then a combination of ip-address and interface name will be used
              to steer requests to the server.  The query-port flag is ignored for any servers which have a source  address  speci‐
              fied but the port may be specified directly as part of the source address. Forcing queries to an interface is not im‐
              plemented on all platforms supported by dnsmasq.

              Upstream servers may be specified with a hostname rather than an IP address.  In this case, dnsmasq will try  to  use
              the  system  resolver  to  get  the IP address of a server during startup. If name resolution fails, starting dnsmasq
              fails, too.  If the system's configuration is such that the system resolver sends DNS queries through the dnsmasq in‐
              stance which is starting up then this will time-out and fail.

       --rev-server=&lt;ip-address&gt;[/&lt;prefix-len&gt;][,&lt;server&gt;][#&lt;port&gt;][@&lt;interface&gt;][@&lt;source-ip&gt;[#&lt;port&gt;]]
              This  is  functionally  the  same  as  --server, but provides some syntactic sugar to make specifying address-to-name
              queries  easier.  For  example  --rev-server=1.2.3.0/24,192.168.0.1  is  exactly  equivalent  to  --server=/3.2.1.in-
              addr.arpa/192.168.0.1  Allowed prefix lengths are 1-32 (IPv4) and 1-128 (IPv6). If the prefix length is omitted, dns‐
              masq substitutes either 32 (IPv4) or 128 (IPv6).

       -A, --address=/&lt;domain&gt;[/&lt;domain&gt;...]/[&lt;ipaddr&gt;]
              Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given domains.  A (or AAAA) queries in the domains are never for‐
              warded  and  always replied to with the specified IP address which may be IPv4 or IPv6. To give multiple addresses or
              both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for a domain, use repeated --address flags.  Note that /etc/hosts and DHCP leases  over‐
              ride  this  for  individual  names.  A  common  use  of this is to redirect the entire doubleclick.net domain to some
              friendly local web server to avoid banner ads. The domain specification works in the same way as for  --server,  with
              the  additional  facility  that  /#/ matches any domain. Thus --address=/#/1.2.3.4 will always return 1.2.3.4 for any
              query not answered from /etc/hosts or DHCP and not sent to an upstream nameserver by a more specific --server  direc‐
              tive.  As  for  --server,  one  or  more domains with no address returns a no-such-domain answer, so --address=/exam‐
              ple.com/ is equivalent to --server=/example.com/ and returns NXDOMAIN for example.com and all its subdomains. An  ad‐
              dress  specified  as  '#' translates to the NULL address of 0.0.0.0 and its IPv6 equivalent of :: so --address=/exam‐
              ple.com/# will return NULL addresses for example.com and its subdomains. This is partly  syntactic  sugar  for  --ad‐
              dress=/example.com/0.0.0.0  and  --address=/example.com/:: but is also more efficient than including both as separate
              configuration lines. Note that NULL addresses normally work in the same way as  localhost,  so  beware  that  clients
              looking up these names are likely to end up talking to themselves.

              Note  that the behaviour for queries which don't match the specified address literal changed in version 2.86.  Previ‐
              ous versions, configured with (eg) --address=/example.com/1.2.3.4 and then queried for a RR type other than  A  would
              return a NoData answer. From  2.86, the query is sent upstream. To restore the pre-2.86 behaviour, use the configura‐
              tion --address=/example.com/1.2.3.4 --local=/example.com/

       --ipset=/&lt;domain&gt;[/&lt;domain&gt;...]/&lt;ipset&gt;[,&lt;ipset&gt;...]
              Places the resolved IP addresses of queries for one or more domains in the specified Netfilter IP  set.  If  multiple
              setnames  are given, then the addresses are placed in each of them, subject to the limitations of an IP set (IPv4 ad‐
              dresses cannot be stored in an IPv6 IP set and vice versa).  Domains and subdomains are matched in the  same  way  as
              --address.  These IP sets must already exist. See ipset(8) for more details.

       --nftset=/&lt;domain&gt;[/&lt;domain&gt;...]/[(6|4)#[&lt;family&gt;#]&lt;table&gt;#&lt;set&gt;[,[(6|4)#[&lt;family&gt;#]&lt;table&gt;#&lt;set&gt;]...]
              Similar  to  the --ipset option, but accepts one or more nftables sets to add IP addresses into.  These sets must al‐
              ready exist. See nft(8) for more details. The family, table and set are passed directly  to  the  nft.  If  the  spec
              starts  with  4#  or  6# then only A or AAAA records respectively are added to the set. Since an nftset can hold only
              IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, this avoids errors being logged for addresses of the wrong type.

       --connmark-allowlist-enable[=&lt;mask&gt;]
              Enables filtering of incoming DNS queries with associated Linux connection track marks according  to  individual  al‐
              lowlists  configured via a series of --connmark-allowlist options. Disallowed queries are not forwarded; they are re‐
              jected with a REFUSED error code.  DNS queries are only allowed if they do not have an  associated  Linux  connection
              track  mark,  or  if  the queried domains match the configured DNS patterns for the associated Linux connection track
              mark. If no allowlist is configured for a Linux connection track mark, all DNS queries associated with that mark  are
              rejected.   If  a  mask is specified, Linux connection track marks are first bitwise ANDed with the given mask before
              being processed.

       --connmark-allowlist=&lt;connmark&gt;[/&lt;mask&gt;][,&lt;pattern&gt;[/&lt;pattern&gt;...]]
              Configures the DNS patterns that are allowed in DNS queries associated with the given Linux  connection  track  mark.
              If a mask is specified, Linux connection track marks are first bitwise ANDed with the given mask before they are com‐
              pared to the given connection track mark.  Patterns follow the syntax of DNS names, but additionally allow the  wild‐
              card  character  "*"  to be used up to twice per label to match 0 or more characters within that label. Note that the
              wildcard never matches a dot (e.g., "*.example.com" matches "api.example.com" but not "api.us.example.com"). Patterns
              must  be  fully  qualified, i.e., consist of at least two labels. The final label must not be fully numeric, and must
              not be the "local" pseudo-TLD. A pattern must end with at least two literal (non-wildcard) labels.  Instead of a pat‐
              tern, "*" can be specified to disable allowlist filtering for a given Linux connection track mark entirely.

       -m, --mx-host=&lt;mx name&gt;[[,&lt;hostname&gt;],&lt;preference&gt;]
              Return an MX record named &lt;mx name&gt; pointing to the given hostname (if given), or the host specified in the --mx-tar‐
              get switch or, if that switch is not given, the host on which dnsmasq is running. The default is useful for directing
              mail  from  systems  on  a LAN to a central server. The preference value is optional, and defaults to 1 if not given.
              More than one MX record may be given for a host.

       -t, --mx-target=&lt;hostname&gt;
              Specify the default target for the MX record returned by dnsmasq. See --mx-host.  If --mx-target is  given,  but  not
              --mx-host, then dnsmasq returns a MX record containing the MX target for MX queries on the hostname of the machine on
              which dnsmasq is running.

       -e, --selfmx
              Return an MX record pointing to itself for each local machine. Local machines are those in /etc/hosts  or  with  DHCP
              leases.

       -L, --localmx
              Return  an  MX record pointing to the host given by --mx-target (or the machine on which dnsmasq is running) for each
              local machine. Local machines are those in /etc/hosts or with DHCP leases.

       -W, --srv-host=&lt;_service&gt;.&lt;_prot&gt;.[&lt;domain&gt;],[&lt;target&gt;[,&lt;port&gt;[,&lt;priority&gt;[,&lt;weight&gt;]]]]
              Return a SRV DNS record. See RFC2782 for details. If not supplied, the domain defaults to  that  given  by  --domain.
              The  default for the target domain is empty, and the default for port is one and the defaults for weight and priority
              are zero. Be careful if transposing data from BIND zone files: the port, weight and priority numbers are in a differ‐
              ent order. More than one SRV record for a given service/domain is allowed, all that match are returned.

       --host-record=&lt;name&gt;[,&lt;name&gt;....],[&lt;IPv4-address&gt;],[&lt;IPv6-address&gt;][,&lt;TTL&gt;]
              Add  A,  AAAA  and  PTR  records to the DNS. This adds one or more names to the DNS with associated IPv4 (A) and IPv6
              (AAAA) records. A name may appear in more than one --host-record and therefore be assigned  more  than  one  address.
              Only the first address creates a PTR record linking the address to the name. This is the same rule as is used reading
              hosts-files.  --host-record options are considered to be read before host-files, so a name appearing  there  inhibits
              PTR-record creation if it appears in hosts-file also. Unlike hosts-files, names are not expanded, even when --expand-
              hosts is in effect. Short and long names  may  appear  in  the  same  --host-record,  eg.   --host-record=laptop,lap‐
              top.thekelleys.org,192.168.0.1,1234::100

              If  the  time-to-live  is  given, it overrides the default, which is zero or the value of --local-ttl. The value is a
              positive integer and gives the time-to-live in seconds.

       --dynamic-host=&lt;name&gt;,[IPv4-address],[IPv6-address],&lt;interface&gt;
              Add A, AAAA and PTR records to the DNS in the same subnet as the specified interface. The address is derived from the
              network part of each address associated with the interface, and the host part from the specified address. For example
              --dynamic-host=example.com,0.0.0.8,eth0 will, when eth0 has the address 192.168.78.x and netmask  255.255.255.0  give
              the  name example.com an A record for 192.168.78.8. The same principle applies to IPv6 addresses. Note that if an in‐
              terface has more than one address, more than one A or AAAA record will be created. The TTL of the records  is  always
              zero, and any changes to interface addresses will be immediately reflected in them.

       -Y, --txt-record=&lt;name&gt;[[,&lt;text&gt;],&lt;text&gt;]
              Return  a  TXT  DNS record. The value of TXT record is a set of strings, so  any number may be included, delimited by
              commas; use quotes to put commas into a string. Note that the maximum length of a single string  is  255  characters,
              longer strings are split into 255 character chunks.

       --ptr-record=&lt;name&gt;[,&lt;target&gt;]
              Return a PTR DNS record.

       --naptr-record=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;order&gt;,&lt;preference&gt;,&lt;flags&gt;,&lt;service&gt;,&lt;regexp&gt;[,&lt;replacement&gt;]
              Return an NAPTR DNS record, as specified in RFC3403.

       --caa-record=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;flags&gt;,&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;value&gt;
              Return a CAA DNS record, as specified in RFC6844.

       --cname=&lt;cname&gt;,[&lt;cname&gt;,]&lt;target&gt;[,&lt;TTL&gt;]
              Return  a CNAME record which indicates that &lt;cname&gt; is really &lt;target&gt;. There is a significant limitation on the tar‐
              get; it must be a DNS record which is known to dnsmasq and NOT a DNS record which comes from an upstream server.  The
              cname must be unique, but it is permissible to have more than one cname pointing to the same target. Indeed it's pos‐
              sible to declare multiple cnames to a target in a single line, like so: --cname=cname1,cname2,target

              If the time-to-live is given, it overrides the default, which is zero or the value of --local-ttl.  The  value  is  a
              positive integer and gives the time-to-live in seconds.

       --dns-rr=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;RR-number&gt;,[&lt;hex data&gt;]
              Return  an  arbitrary  DNS Resource Record. The number is the type of the record (which is always in the C_IN class).
              The value of the record is given by the hex data, which may be of the form 01:23:45 or 01 23 45 or 012345 or any mix‐
              ture of these.

       --interface-name=&lt;name&gt;,&lt;interface&gt;[/4|/6]
              Return DNS records associating the name with the address(es) of the given interface. This flag specifies an A or AAAA
              record for the given name in the same way as an /etc/hosts line, except that the address is not constant,  but  taken
              from  the  given interface. The interface may be followed by "/4" or "/6" to specify that only IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
              of the interface should be used. If the interface is down, not configured or non-existent, an  empty  record  is  re‐
              turned. The matching PTR record is also created, mapping the interface address to the name. More than one name may be
              associated with an interface address by repeating the flag; in that case the first instance is used for  the  reverse
              address-to-name mapping. Note that a name used in --interface-name may not appear in /etc/hosts.

       --synth-domain=&lt;domain&gt;,&lt;address range&gt;[,&lt;prefix&gt;[*]]
              Create  artificial  A/AAAA and PTR records for an address range. The records either seqential numbers or the address,
              with periods (or colons for IPv6) replaced with dashes.

              An    examples    should    make    this    clearer.    First     sequential     numbers.      --synth-domain=thekel‐
              leys.org.uk,192.168.0.50,192.168.0.70,internal-*   results   in   the  name  internal-0.thekelleys.org.uk.  returning
              192.168.0.50, internal-1.thekelleys.org.uk returning 192.168.0.51 and so on. (note the *) The same principle  applies
              to IPv6 addresses (where the numbers may be very large). Reverse lookups from address to name behave as expected.

              Second,   --synth-domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24,internal-  (no  *)  will  result  in  a  query  for  inter‐
              nal-192-168-0-56.thekelleys.org.uk returning 192.168.0.56 and a reverse query vice versa. The same applies  to  IPv6,
              but  IPv6 addresses may start with '::' but DNS labels may not start with '-' so in this case if no prefix is config‐
              ured a zero is added in front of the label. ::1 becomes 0--1.

              V4 mapped IPv6 addresses, which have a representation like ::ffff:1.2.3.4 are  handled  specially,  and  become  like
              0--ffff-1-2-3-4

              The  address  range can be of the form &lt;start address&gt;,&lt;end address&gt; or &lt;ip address&gt;/&lt;prefix-length&gt; in both forms of
              the option. For IPv6 the start and end addresses must fall in the same /64 network, or prefix-length must be  greater
              than or equal to 64 except that shorter prefix lengths than 64 are allowed only if non-sequential names are in use.

       --dumpfile=&lt;path/to/file&gt;
              Specify  the  location  of a pcap-format file which dnsmasq uses to dump copies of network packets for debugging pur‐
              poses. If the file exists when dnsmasq starts, it is not deleted; new packets are added to the end.

       --dumpmask=&lt;mask&gt;
              Specify which types of packets should be added to the dumpfile. The argument should be the OR  of  the  bitmasks  for
              each type of packet to be dumped: it can be specified in hex by preceding the number with 0x in  the normal way. Each
              time a packet is written to the dumpfile, dnsmasq logs the packet sequence and the mask representing  its  type.  The
              current  types  are:  0x0001  -  DNS queries from clients, 0x0002 DNS replies to clients, 0x0004 - DNS queries to up‐
              stream, 0x0008 - DNS replies from upstream, 0x0010 - queries send upstream for DNSSEC validation, 0x0020 - replies to
              queries  for  DNSSEC  validation,  0x0040 - replies to client queries which fail DNSSEC validation, 0x0080 replies to
              queries for DNSSEC validation which fail validation, 0x1000 - DHCPv4, 0x2000 - DHCPv6, 0x4000 - Router advertisement,
              0x8000 - TFTP.

       --add-mac[=base64|text]
              Add  the  MAC address of the requestor to DNS queries which are forwarded upstream. This may be used to DNS filtering
              by the upstream server. The MAC address can only be added if the requestor is on  the  same  subnet  as  the  dnsmasq
              server.  Note  that  the  mechanism used to achieve this (an EDNS0 option) is not yet standardised, so this should be
              considered experimental. Also note that exposing MAC addresses in this way may have  security  and  privacy  implica‐
              tions. The warning about caching given for --add-subnet applies to --add-mac too. An alternative encoding of the MAC,
              as base64, is enabled by adding the "base64" parameter and a human-readable encoding of hex-and-colons is enabled  by
              added the "text" parameter.

       --strip-mac
              Remove any MAC address information already in downstream queries before forwarding upstream.

       --add-cpe-id=&lt;string&gt;
              Add an arbitrary identifying string to DNS queries which are forwarded upstream.

       --add-subnet[[=[&lt;IPv4 address&gt;/]&lt;IPv4 prefix length&gt;][,[&lt;IPv6 address&gt;/]&lt;IPv6 prefix length&gt;]]
              Add a subnet address to the DNS queries which are forwarded upstream. If an address is specified in the flag, it will
              be used, otherwise, the address of the requestor will be used. The amount of the address  forwarded  depends  on  the
              prefix  length  parameter: 32 (128 for IPv6) forwards the whole address, zero forwards none of it but still marks the
              request so that no upstream nameserver will add client address information either. The default is zero for both  IPv4
              and IPv6. Note that upstream nameservers may be configured to return different results based on this information, but
              the dnsmasq cache does not take account. Caching is therefore disabled for such replies, unless  the  subnet  address
              being added is constant.

              For  example,  --add-subnet=24,96 will add the /24 and /96 subnets of the requestor for IPv4 and IPv6 requestors, re‐
              spectively.  --add-subnet=1.2.3.4/24 will add 1.2.3.0/24 for IPv4 requestors and ::/0 for  IPv6  requestors.   --add-
              subnet=1.2.3.4/24,1.2.3.4/24 will add 1.2.3.0/24 for both IPv4 and IPv6 requestors.

       --strip-subnet
              Remove any subnet address already present in a downstream query before forwarding it upstream. If --add-subnet is set
              this also ensures that any downstream-provided subnet is replaced by the one added  by  dnsmasq.  Otherwise,  dnsmasq
              will NOT replace an existing subnet in the query.

       --umbrella[=[deviceid:&lt;deviceid&gt;][,orgid:&lt;orgid&gt;][,assetid:&lt;id&gt;]]
              Embeds  the  requestor's  IP address in DNS queries forwarded upstream.  If device id or, asset id or organization id
              are specified, the information is included in the forwarded queries and may be able to be used in filtering  policies
              and  reporting.  The  order  of the id attributes is irrelevant, but they must be separated by a comma. Deviceid is a
              sixteen digit hexadecimal number, org and asset ids are decimal numbers.

       -c, --cache-size=&lt;cachesize&gt;
              Set the size of dnsmasq's cache. The default is 150 names. Setting the cache size to  zero  disables  caching.  Note:
              huge cache size impacts performance.

       -N, --no-negcache
              Disable  negative  caching.  Negative caching allows dnsmasq to remember "no such domain" answers from upstream name‐
              servers and answer identical queries without forwarding them again.

       --no-round-robin
              Dnsmasq normally permutes the order of A or AAAA records for the same name on successive queries, for load-balancing.
              This  turns  off that behaviour, so that the records are always returned in the order that they are received from up‐
              stream.

       --use-stale-cache[=&lt;max TTL excess in s&gt;]
              When set, if a DNS name exists in the cache, but its time-to-live has expired, dnsmasq will return the  data  anyway.
              (It  attempts  to refresh the data with an upstream query after returning the stale data.) This can improve speed and
              reliability. It comes at the expense of sometimes returning out-of-date data and less  efficient  cache  utilisation,
              since  old  data cannot be flushed when its TTL expires, so the cache becomes mostly least-recently-used. To mitigate
              issues caused by massively outdated DNS replies, the maximum overaging of cached records can be specified in  seconds
              (defaulting  to  not  serve  anything older than one day). Setting the TTL excess time to zero will serve stale cache
              data regardless how long it has expired.

       -0, --dns-forward-max=&lt;queries&gt;
              Set the maximum number of concurrent DNS queries. The default value is 150, which should be fine for most setups. The
              only known situation where this needs to be increased is when using web-server log file resolvers, which can generate
              large numbers of concurrent queries. This parameter actually controls the number of  concurrent  queries  per  server
              group,  where  a  server  group  is the set of server(s) associated with a single domain. So if a domain has it's own
              server via --server=/example.com/1.2.3.4 and 1.2.3.4 is not responding, but queries for *.example.com cannot go else‐
              where,  then  other queries will not be affected. On configurations with many such server groups and tight resources,
              this value may need to be reduced.

       --dnssec
              Validate DNS replies and cache DNSSEC data. When forwarding DNS queries, dnsmasq requests the DNSSEC  records  needed
              to  validate  the replies. The replies are validated and the result returned as the Authenticated Data bit in the DNS
              packet. In addition the DNSSEC records are stored in the cache, making validation by  clients  more  efficient.  Note
              that validation by clients is the most secure DNSSEC mode, but for clients unable to do validation, use of the AD bit
              set by dnsmasq is useful, provided that the network between the dnsmasq server and the  client  is  trusted.  Dnsmasq
              must be compiled with HAVE_DNSSEC enabled, and DNSSEC trust anchors provided, see --trust-anchor.  Because the DNSSEC
              validation process uses the cache, it is not permitted to reduce the cache size below the default when DNSSEC is  en‐
              abled.  The nameservers upstream of dnsmasq must be DNSSEC-capable, ie capable of returning DNSSEC records with data.
              If they are not, then dnsmasq will not be able to determine the trusted status of answers and  this  means  that  DNS
              service will be entirely broken.

       --trust-anchor=[&lt;class&gt;],&lt;domain&gt;,&lt;key-tag&gt;,&lt;algorithm&gt;,&lt;digest-type&gt;,&lt;digest&gt;
              Provide  DS  records  to  act a trust anchors for DNSSEC validation. Typically these will be the DS record(s) for Key
              Signing key(s) (KSK) of the root zone, but trust anchors for limited domains are also possible. The current root-zone
              trust anchors may be downloaded from https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml

       --dnssec-check-unsigned[=no]
              As  a  default, dnsmasq checks that unsigned DNS replies are legitimate: this entails possible extra queries even for
              the majority of DNS zones which are not, at the moment, signed. If --dnssec-check-unsigned=no appears in the configu‐
              ration,  then  such  replies  they  are  assumed  to be valid and passed on (without the "authentic data" bit set, of
              course). This does not protect against an attacker forging unsigned replies for signed DNS zones, but it is fast.

              Versions of dnsmasq prior to 2.80 defaulted to not checking unsigned replies,  and  used  --dnssec-check-unsigned  to
              switch  this on. Such configurations will continue to work as before, but those which used the default of no checking
              will need to be altered to explicitly select no checking. The new default is because switching off checking  for  un‐
              signed  replies is inherently dangerous. Not only does it open the possiblity of forged replies, but it allows every‐
              thing to appear to be working even when the upstream namesevers do not support DNSSEC, and in  this  case  no  DNSSEC
              validation at all is occurring.

       --dnssec-no-timecheck
              DNSSEC  signatures are only valid for specified time windows, and should be rejected outside those windows. This gen‐
              erates an interesting chicken-and-egg problem for machines which don't have a hardware real time clock. For these ma‐
              chines  to  determine  the  correct time typically requires use of NTP and therefore DNS, but validating DNS requires
              that the correct time is already known. Setting this flag removes the time-window checks (but not other DNSSEC  vali‐
              dation.)  only  until  the dnsmasq process receives SIGINT. The intention is that dnsmasq should be started with this
              flag when the platform determines that reliable time is not currently available. As soon as reliable time  is  estab‐
              lished,  a  SIGINT  should be sent to dnsmasq, which enables time checking, and purges the cache of DNS records which
              have not been thoroughly checked.

              Earlier versions of dnsmasq overloaded SIGHUP (which re-reads much configuration) to also enable time validation.

              If dnsmasq is run in debug mode (--no-daemon flag) then SIGINT retains its usual meaning of terminating  the  dnsmasq
              process.

       --dnssec-timestamp=&lt;path&gt;
              Enables  an  alternative  way  of checking the validity of the system time for DNSSEC (see --dnssec-no-timecheck). In
              this case, the system time is considered to be valid once it becomes later than the timestamp on the specified  file.
              The  file is created and its timestamp set automatically by dnsmasq. The file must be stored on a persistent filesys‐
              tem, so that it and its mtime are carried over system restarts. The timestamp  file  is  created  after  dnsmasq  has
              dropped root, so it must be in a location writable by the unprivileged user that dnsmasq runs as.

       --proxy-dnssec
              Copy the DNSSEC Authenticated Data bit from upstream servers to downstream clients.  This is an alternative to having
              dnsmasq validate DNSSEC, but it depends on the security of the network between dnsmasq and the upstream servers,  and
              the  trustworthiness  of the upstream servers. Note that caching the Authenticated Data bit correctly in all cases is
              not technically possible. If the AD bit is to be relied upon when using this option, then the cache  should  be  dis‐
              abled using --cache-size=0. In most cases, enabling DNSSEC validation within dnsmasq is a better option. See --dnssec
              for details.

       --dnssec-debug
              Set debugging mode for the DNSSEC validation, set the Checking Disabled bit on upstream queries,  and  don't  convert
              replies  which do not validate to responses with a return code of SERVFAIL. Note that setting this may affect DNS be‐
              haviour in bad ways, it is not an extra-logging flag and should not be set in production.

       --auth-zone=&lt;domain&gt;[,&lt;subnet&gt;[/&lt;prefix        length&gt;][,&lt;subnet&gt;[/&lt;prefix         length&gt;].....][,exclude:&lt;subnet&gt;[/&lt;prefix
       length&gt;]].....]
              Define a DNS zone for which dnsmasq acts as authoritative server. Locally defined DNS records which are in the domain
              will be served. If subnet(s) are given, A and AAAA records must be in one of the specified subnets.

              As alternative to directly specifying the subnets, it's possible to give the name of an interface, in which case  the
              subnets  implied by that interface's configured addresses and netmask/prefix-length are used; this is useful when us‐
              ing constructed DHCP ranges as the actual address is dynamic and not known when configuring  dnsmasq.  The  interface
              addresses  may  be  confined  to only IPv6 addresses using &lt;interface&gt;/6 or to only IPv4 using &lt;interface&gt;/4. This is
              useful when an interface has dynamically determined global IPv6 addresses  which  should  appear  in  the  zone,  but
              RFC1918 IPv4 addresses which should not.  Interface-name and address-literal subnet specifications may be used freely
              in the same --auth-zone declaration.

              It's possible to exclude certain IP addresses from responses. It can be used, to make sure that answers contain  only
              global routeable IP addresses (by excluding loopback, RFC1918 and ULA addresses).

              The  subnet(s) are also used to define in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa domains which are served for reverse-DNS queries. If
              not specified, the prefix length defaults to 24 for IPv4 and 64 for IPv6.  For IPv4 subnets, the prefix length should
              be have the value 8, 16 or 24 unless you are familiar with RFC 2317 and have arranged the in-addr.arpa delegation ac‐
              cordingly. Note that if no subnets are specified, then no reverse queries are answered.

       --auth-soa=&lt;serial&gt;[,&lt;hostmaster&gt;[,&lt;refresh&gt;[,&lt;retry&gt;[,&lt;expiry&gt;]]]]
              Specify fields in the SOA record associated with authoritative zones. Note that this is optional, all the values  are
              set to sane defaults.

       --auth-sec-servers=&lt;domain&gt;[,&lt;domain&gt;[,&lt;domain&gt;...]]
              Specify  any secondary servers for a zone for which dnsmasq is authoritative. These servers must be configured to get
              zone data from dnsmasq by zone transfer, and answer queries for the same authoritative zones as dnsmasq.

       --auth-peer=&lt;ip-address&gt;[,&lt;ip-address&gt;[,&lt;ip-address&gt;...]]
              Specify the addresses of secondary servers which are allowed to initiate zone transfer (AXFR) requests for zones  for
              which dnsmasq is authoritative. If this option is not given but --auth-sec-servers is, then AXFR requests will be ac‐
              cepted from any secondary. Specifying --auth-peer without --auth-sec-servers enables zone transfer but does  not  ad‐
              vertise the secondary in NS records returned by dnsmasq.

       --conntrack
              Read  the  Linux  connection  track mark associated with incoming DNS queries and set the same mark value on upstream
              traffic used to answer those queries. This allows traffic generated by dnsmasq to  be  associated  with  the  queries
              which  cause it, useful for bandwidth accounting and firewalling. Dnsmasq must have conntrack support compiled in and
              the kernel must have conntrack support included and configured. This option cannot be combined with --query-port.

       -F,      --dhcp-range=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;],][set:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;start-addr&gt;[,&lt;end-addr&gt;|&lt;mode&gt;[,&lt;netmask&gt;[,&lt;broadcast&gt;]]][,&lt;lease
       time&gt;]

       -F,                    --dhcp-range=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;],][set:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;start-IPv6addr&gt;[,&lt;end-IPv6addr&gt;|constructor:&lt;inter‐
       face&gt;][,&lt;mode&gt;][,&lt;prefix-len&gt;][,&lt;lease time&gt;]

              Enable the DHCP server. Addresses will be given out from the range &lt;start-addr&gt; to &lt;end-addr&gt; and from statically de‐
              fined  addresses  given in --dhcp-host options. If the lease time is given, then leases will be given for that length
              of time. The lease time is in seconds, or minutes (eg 45m) or hours (eg 1h) or days (2d) or weeks (1w) or "infinite".
              If  not  given,  the default lease time is one hour for IPv4 and one day for IPv6. The minimum lease time is two min‐
              utes. For IPv6 ranges, the lease time maybe "deprecated"; this sets the preferred lifetime sent in a  DHCP  lease  or
              router  advertisement  to  zero,  which causes clients to use other addresses, if available, for new connections as a
              prelude to renumbering.

              This option may be repeated, with different addresses, to enable DHCP service to more than one network. For  directly
              connected networks (ie, networks on which the machine running dnsmasq has an interface) the netmask is optional: dns‐
              masq will determine it from the interface configuration. For networks which receive DHCP service via a  relay  agent,
              dnsmasq  cannot  determine the netmask itself, so it should be specified, otherwise dnsmasq will have to guess, based
              on the class (A, B or C) of the network address. The broadcast address is always optional. It is  always  allowed  to
              have more than one --dhcp-range in a single subnet.

              For  IPv6, the parameters are slightly different: instead of netmask and broadcast address, there is an optional pre‐
              fix length which must be equal to or larger then the prefix length on the local interface. If  not  given,  this  de‐
              faults  to 64. Unlike the IPv4 case, the prefix length is not automatically derived from the interface configuration.
              The minimum size of the prefix length is 64.

              IPv6 (only) supports another type of range. In this, the start address and optional end address contain only the net‐
              work  part  (ie  ::1) and they are followed by constructor:&lt;interface&gt;.  This forms a template which describes how to
              create ranges, based on the addresses assigned to the interface. For instance

              --dhcp-range=::1,::400,constructor:eth0

              will look for addresses on eth0 and then create a range from &lt;network&gt;::1 to &lt;network&gt;::400. If the interface is  as‐
              signed  more  than  one network, then the corresponding ranges will be automatically created, and then deprecated and
              finally removed again as the address is deprecated and then deleted. The interface name may have a  final  "*"  wild‐
              card. Note that just any address on eth0 will not do: it must not be an autoconfigured or privacy address, or be dep‐
              recated.

              If a --dhcp-range is only being used for stateless DHCP and/or SLAAC, then the address can be simply ::

              --dhcp-range=::,constructor:eth0

              The optional set:&lt;tag&gt; sets an alphanumeric label which marks this network so that DHCP options may be specified on a
              per-network  basis.  When it is prefixed with 'tag:' instead, then its meaning changes from setting a tag to matching
              it. Only one tag may be set, but more than one tag may be matched.

              The optional &lt;mode&gt; keyword may be static which tells dnsmasq to enable DHCP for the network specified,  but  not  to
              dynamically  allocate  IP addresses: only hosts which have static addresses given via --dhcp-host or from /etc/ethers
              will be served. A static-only subnet with address all zeros may be used as a "catch-all" address to enable replies to
              all Information-request packets on a subnet which is provided with stateless DHCPv6, ie --dhcp-range=::,static

              For  IPv4, the &lt;mode&gt; may be proxy in which case dnsmasq will provide proxy-DHCP on the specified subnet. (See --pxe-
              prompt and --pxe-service for details.)

              For IPv6, the mode may be some combination of ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-stateless, ra-advrouter, off-link.

              ra-only tells dnsmasq to offer Router Advertisement only on this subnet, and not DHCP.

              slaac tells dnsmasq to offer Router Advertisement on this subnet and to set the A bit in the router advertisement, so
              that  the  client  will  use  SLAAC addresses. When used with a DHCP range or static DHCP address this results in the
              client having both a DHCP-assigned and a SLAAC address.

              ra-stateless sends router advertisements with the O and A bits set, and provides a stateless DHCP service. The client
              will use a SLAAC address, and use DHCP for other configuration information.

              ra-names  enables  a  mode which gives DNS names to dual-stack hosts which do SLAAC for IPv6. Dnsmasq uses the host's
              IPv4 lease to derive the name, network segment and MAC address and assumes that the host will also have an  IPv6  ad‐
              dress calculated using the SLAAC algorithm, on the same network segment. The address is pinged, and if a reply is re‐
              ceived, an AAAA record is added to the DNS for this IPv6 address. Note that this is only  happens  for  directly-con‐
              nected  networks,  (not  one doing DHCP via a relay) and it will not work if a host is using privacy extensions.  ra-
              names can be combined  with ra-stateless and slaac.

              ra-advrouter enables a mode where router address(es) rather than prefix(es) are included in the advertisements.  This
              is  described  in RFC-3775 section 7.2 and is used in mobile IPv6. In this mode the interval option is also included,
              as described in RFC-3775 section 7.3.

              off-link tells dnsmasq to advertise the prefix without the on-link (aka L) bit set.

       -G, --dhcp-host=[&lt;hwaddr&gt;][,id:&lt;client_id&gt;|*][,set:&lt;tag&gt;][,tag:&lt;tag&gt;][,&lt;ipaddr&gt;][,&lt;hostname&gt;][,&lt;lease_time&gt;][,ignore]
              Specify per host parameters for the DHCP server. This allows a machine with a particular hardware address to  be  al‐
              ways allocated the same hostname, IP address and lease time. A hostname specified like this overrides any supplied by
              the DHCP client on the machine. It is also allowable to omit the hardware address and include the hostname, in  which
              case  the  IP  address  and  lease  times  will  apply  to  any  machine  claiming  that  name.  For  example --dhcp-
              host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,wap,infinite tells dnsmasq to give the machine with  hardware  address  00:20:e0:3b:13:af  the
              name wap, and an infinite DHCP lease.  --dhcp-host=lap,192.168.0.199 tells dnsmasq to always allocate the machine lap
              the IP address 192.168.0.199.

              Addresses allocated like this are not constrained to be in the range given by the --dhcp-range option, but they  must
              be  in  the  same  subnet as some valid dhcp-range.  For subnets which don't need a pool of dynamically allocated ad‐
              dresses, use the "static" keyword in the --dhcp-range declaration.

              It is allowed to use client identifiers (called client DUID in IPv6-land) rather than hardware addresses to  identify
              hosts  by  prefixing  with  'id:'.  Thus: --dhcp-host=id:01:02:03:04,.....  refers to the host with client identifier
              01:02:03:04. It is also allowed to specify the client ID as text, like this: --dhcp-host=id:clientidastext,.....

              A single --dhcp-host may contain an IPv4 address or one or more IPv6 addresses,  or  both.  IPv6  addresses  must  be
              bracketed  by square brackets thus: --dhcp-host=laptop,[1234::56] IPv6 addresses may contain only the host-identifier
              part: --dhcp-host=laptop,[::56] in which case they act as wildcards in constructed DHCP ranges, with the  appropriate
              network  part  inserted. For IPv6, an address may include a prefix length: --dhcp-host=laptop,[1234:50/126] which (in
              this case) specifies four addresses, 1234::50 to 1234::53. This (an the ability to  specify  multiple  addresses)  is
              useful  when  a  host presents either a consistent name or hardware-ID, but varying DUIDs, since it allows dnsmasq to
              honour the static address allocation but assign a different adddress for each DUID. This typically occurs when  chain
              netbooting, as each stage of the chain gets in turn allocates an address.

              Note  that  in  IPv6  DHCP,  the  hardware  address  may not be available, though it normally is for direct-connected
              clients, or clients using DHCP relays which support RFC 6939.

              For DHCPv4, the  special option id:* means "ignore any client-id and use MAC addresses only." This is useful  when  a
              client presents a client-id sometimes but not others.

              If  a  name appears in /etc/hosts, the associated address can be allocated to a DHCP lease, but only if a --dhcp-host
              option specifying the name also exists. Only one hostname can be given in a --dhcp-host option, but aliases are  pos‐
              sible  by  using CNAMEs. (See --cname ). Note that /etc/hosts is NOT used when the DNS server side of dnsmasq is dis‐
              abled by setting the DNS server port to zero.

              More than one --dhcp-host can be associated (by name, hardware address or UID) with a host. Which one  is  used  (and
              therefore which address is allocated by DHCP and appears in the DNS) depends on the subnet on which the host last ob‐
              tained a DHCP lease: the --dhcp-host with an address within the subnet is used. If more than one  address  is  within
              the  subnet,  the  result is undefined. A corollary to this is that the name associated with a host using --dhcp-host
              does not appear in the DNS until the host obtains a DHCP lease.

              The special keyword "ignore" tells dnsmasq to never offer a DHCP lease to a machine. The machine can be specified  by
              hardware  address, client ID or hostname, for instance --dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:af,ignore This is useful when there
              is another DHCP server on the network which should be used by some machines.

              The set:&lt;tag&gt; construct sets the tag whenever this --dhcp-host directive is in use. This can be used  to  selectively
              send  DHCP  options  just  for  this  host. More than one tag can be set in a --dhcp-host directive (but not in other
              places where "set:&lt;tag&gt;" is allowed). When a host matches any --dhcp-host directive (or one implied  by  /etc/ethers)
              then  the  special  tag "known" is set. This allows dnsmasq to be configured to ignore requests from unknown machines
              using --dhcp-ignore=tag:!known If the host matches only a --dhcp-host directive which cannot be used because it spec‐
              ifies an address on different subnet, the tag "known-othernet" is set.

              The  tag:&lt;tag&gt; construct filters which dhcp-host directives are used; more than one can be provided, in this case the
              request must match all of them. Tagged directives are used in preference to untagged ones. Note that one of &lt;hwaddr&gt;,
              &lt;client_id&gt; or &lt;hostname&gt; still needs to be specified (can be a wildcard).

              Ethernet  addresses  (but not client-ids) may have wildcard bytes, so for example --dhcp-host=00:20:e0:3b:13:*,ignore
              will cause dnsmasq to ignore a range of hardware addresses. Note that the "*" will need to be escaped or quoted on  a
              command line, but not in the configuration file.

              Hardware addresses normally match any network (ARP) type, but it is possible to restrict them to a single ARP type by
              preceding them with the ARP-type (in HEX) and "-". so --dhcp-host=06-00:20:e0:3b:13:af,1.2.3.4 will only match a  To‐
              ken-Ring hardware address, since the ARP-address type for token ring is 6.

              As   a  special  case,  in  DHCPv4,  it  is  possible  to  include  more  than  one  hardware  address.  eg:  --dhcp-
              host=11:22:33:44:55:66,12:34:56:78:90:12,192.168.0.2 This allows an IP address to be associated with  multiple  hard‐
              ware  addresses,  and  gives dnsmasq permission to abandon a DHCP lease to one of the hardware addresses when another
              one asks for a lease. Beware that this is a dangerous thing to do, it will only work reliably  if  only  one  of  the
              hardware addresses is active at any time and there is no way for dnsmasq to enforce this. It is, for instance, useful
              to allocate a stable IP address to a laptop which has both wired and wireless interfaces.

       --dhcp-hostsfile=&lt;path&gt;
              Read DHCP host information from the specified file. If a directory is given, then read all  the  files  contained  in
              that  directory in alphabetical order. The file contains information about one host per line. The format of a line is
              the same as text to the right of '=' in --dhcp-host. The advantage of storing DHCP host information in this  file  is
              that it can be changed without re-starting dnsmasq: the file will be re-read when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP.

       --dhcp-optsfile=&lt;path&gt;
              Read  DHCP option information from the specified file.  If a directory is given, then read all the files contained in
              that directory in alphabetical order. The advantage of using this option is the same  as  for  --dhcp-hostsfile:  the
              --dhcp-optsfile will be re-read when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP. Note that it is possible to encode the information in a
              --dhcp-boot flag as DHCP options, using the options names bootfile-name, server-ip-address and tftp-server. This  al‐
              lows these to be included in a --dhcp-optsfile.

       --dhcp-hostsdir=&lt;path&gt;
              This is equivalent to --dhcp-hostsfile, except for the following. The path MUST be a directory, and not an individual
              file. Changed or new files within the directory are read automatically, without the need to send SIGHUP.  If  a  file
              is  deleted or changed after it has been read by dnsmasq, then the host record it contained will remain until dnsmasq
              receives a SIGHUP, or is restarted; ie host records are only added dynamically. The order in which the files in a di‐
              rectory are read is not defined.

       --dhcp-optsdir=&lt;path&gt;
              This is equivalent to --dhcp-optsfile, with the differences noted for --dhcp-hostsdir.

       -Z, --read-ethers
              Read  /etc/ethers  for  information about hosts for the DHCP server. The format of /etc/ethers is a hardware address,
              followed by either a hostname or dotted-quad IP address. When read by dnsmasq these lines have exactly the  same  ef‐
              fect  as  --dhcp-host  options  containing the same information. /etc/ethers is re-read when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP.
              IPv6 addresses are NOT read from /etc/ethers.

       -O,         --dhcp-option=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]][encap:&lt;opt&gt;,][vi-encap:&lt;enterprise&gt;,][vendor:[&lt;vendor-class&gt;],][&lt;opt&gt;|op‐
       tion:&lt;opt-name&gt;|option6:&lt;opt&gt;|option6:&lt;opt-name&gt;],[&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]]
              Specify  different or extra options to DHCP clients. By default, dnsmasq sends some standard options to DHCP clients,
              the netmask and broadcast address are set to the same as the host running dnsmasq, and the  DNS  server  and  default
              route  are  set  to the address of the machine running dnsmasq. (Equivalent rules apply for IPv6.) If the domain name
              option has been set, that is sent.  This configuration allows these defaults to be overridden, or other options spec‐
              ified.  The  option,  to be sent may be given as a decimal number or as "option:&lt;option-name&gt;" The option numbers are
              specified in RFC2132 and subsequent RFCs. The set of option-names known by dnsmasq can be discovered by running "dns‐
              masq  --help  dhcp".   For example, to set the default route option to 192.168.4.4, do --dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.4 or
              --dhcp-option = option:router, 192.168.4.4 and to set the time-server address  to  192.168.0.4,  do  --dhcp-option  =
              42,192.168.0.4  or  --dhcp-option  = option:ntp-server, 192.168.0.4 The special address 0.0.0.0 is taken to mean "the
              address of the machine running dnsmasq".

              Data types allowed are comma separated dotted-quad IPv4 addresses,  []-wrapped  IPv6  addresses,  a  decimal  number,
              colon-separated  hex  digits and a text string. If the optional tags are given then this option is only sent when all
              the tags are matched.

              Special processing is done on a text argument for option 119, to conform with RFC 3397. Text or  dotted-quad  IP  ad‐
              dresses  as  arguments  to  option  120 are handled as per RFC 3361. Dotted-quad IP addresses which are followed by a
              slash and then a netmask size are encoded as described in RFC 3442.

              IPv6 options are specified using the option6: keyword, followed by the option number or option name. The IPv6  option
              name  space  is  disjoint  from  the  IPv4 option name space. IPv6 addresses in options must be bracketed with square
              brackets, eg.  --dhcp-option=option6:ntp-server,[1234::56] For IPv6, [::] means "the global address  of  the  machine
              running dnsmasq", whilst [fd00::] is replaced with the ULA, if it exists, and [fe80::] with the link-local address.

              Be  careful: no checking is done that the correct type of data for the option number is sent, it is quite possible to
              persuade dnsmasq to generate illegal DHCP packets with injudicious use of this flag. When the value is a decimal num‐
              ber, dnsmasq must determine how large the data item is. It does this by examining the option number and/or the value,
              but can be overridden by appending a single letter flag as follows: b = one byte, s = two bytes, i = four bytes. This
              is mainly useful with encapsulated vendor class options (see below) where dnsmasq cannot determine data size from the
              option number. Option data which consists solely of periods and digits will be interpreted by dnsmasq as  an  IP  ad‐
              dress,  and inserted into an option as such. To force a literal string, use quotes. For instance when using option 66
              to send a literal IP address as TFTP server name, it is necessary to do --dhcp-option=66,"1.2.3.4"

              Encapsulated Vendor-class options may also be specified (IPv4 only)  using  --dhcp-option:  for  instance  --dhcp-op‐
              tion=vendor:PXEClient,1,0.0.0.0  sends  the  encapsulated  vendor class-specific option "mftp-address=0.0.0.0" to any
              client whose vendor-class matches "PXEClient". The vendor-class matching is substring based  (see  --dhcp-vendorclass
              for  details).  If a vendor-class option (number 60) is sent by dnsmasq, then that is used for selecting encapsulated
              options in preference to any sent by the client. It is  possible  to  omit  the  vendorclass  completely;  --dhcp-op‐
              tion=vendor:,1,0.0.0.0 in which case the encapsulated option is always sent.

              Options  may  be  encapsulated  (IPv4  only)  within other options: for instance --dhcp-option=encap:175, 190, iscsi-
              client0 will send option 175, within which is the option 190. If multiple options are given  which  are  encapsulated
              with  the  same  option number then they will be correctly combined into one encapsulated option.  encap: and vendor:
              are may not both be set in the same --dhcp-option.

              The final variant on encapsulated options is "Vendor-Identifying Vendor Options" as specified by RFC3925.  These  are
              denoted like this: --dhcp-option=vi-encap:2, 10, text The number in the vi-encap: section is the IANA enterprise num‐
              ber used to identify this option. This form of encapsulation is supported in IPv6.

              The address 0.0.0.0 is not treated specially in encapsulated options.

       --dhcp-option-force=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]][encap:&lt;opt&gt;,][vi-encap:&lt;enterprise&gt;,][vendor:[&lt;vendor-
       class&gt;],]&lt;opt&gt;,[&lt;value&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]]
              This  works  in  exactly the same way as --dhcp-option except that the option will always be sent, even if the client
              does not ask for it in the parameter request list. This is sometimes needed, for example when sending options to  PX‐
              ELinux.

       --dhcp-no-override
              (IPv4 only) Disable re-use of the DHCP servername and filename fields as extra option space. If it can, dnsmasq moves
              the boot server and filename information (from --dhcp-boot) out of their dedicated fields  into  DHCP  options.  This
              make  extra  space available in the DHCP packet for options but can, rarely, confuse old or broken clients. This flag
              forces "simple and safe" behaviour to avoid problems in such a case.

       --dhcp-relay=&lt;local address&gt;[,&lt;server address&gt;[#&lt;server port&gt;]][,&lt;interface]
              Configure dnsmasq to do DHCP relay. The local address is an address allocated to an interface  on  the  host  running
              dnsmasq.  All DHCP requests arriving on that interface will we relayed to a remote DHCP server at the server address.
              It is possible to relay from a single local address to multiple remote servers by using multiple --dhcp-relay configs
              with the same local address and different server addresses. A server address must be an IP literal address, not a do‐
              main name. If the server address is omitted, the request will be forwarded by broadcast (IPv4) or  multicast  (IPv6).
              In  this  case the interface must be given and not be wildcard. The server address may specify a non-standard port to
              relay to. If this is used then --dhcp-proxy should likely also be set, otherwise parts of the DHCP conversation which
              do not pass through the relay will be delivered to the wrong port.

              Access  control for DHCP clients has the same rules as for the DHCP server, see --interface, --except-interface, etc.
              The optional interface name in the --dhcp-relay config has a different function: it controls on which interface  DHCP
              replies  from the server will be accepted. This is intended for configurations which have three interfaces: one being
              relayed from, a second connecting the DHCP server, and a third untrusted network, typically the  wider  internet.  It
              avoids the possibility of spoof replies arriving via this third interface.

              It  is  allowed to have dnsmasq act as a DHCP server on one set of interfaces and relay from a disjoint set of inter‐
              faces. Note that whilst it is quite possible to write configurations which appear to act as a server and a  relay  on
              the same interface, this is not supported: the relay function will take precedence.

              Both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 relay is supported. It's not possible to relay DHCPv4 to a DHCPv6 server or vice-versa.

              The  DHCP relay function for IPv6 includes the ability to snoop prefix-delegation from relayed DHCP transactions. See
              --dhcp-script for details.

       -U, --dhcp-vendorclass=set:&lt;tag&gt;,[enterprise:&lt;IANA-enterprise number&gt;,]&lt;vendor-class&gt;
              Map from a vendor-class string to a tag. Most DHCP clients provide a "vendor class" which represents, in some  sense,
              the  type of host. This option maps vendor classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be selectively delivered to dif‐
              ferent classes of hosts. For example --dhcp-vendorclass=set:printers,Hewlett-Packard JetDirect will allow options  to
              be  set  only  for HP printers like so: --dhcp-option=tag:printers,3,192.168.4.4 The vendor-class string is substring
              matched against the vendor-class supplied by the client, to allow fuzzy matching. The set: prefix is optional but al‐
              lowed for consistency.

              Note that in IPv6 only, vendorclasses are namespaced with an IANA-allocated enterprise number. This is given with en‐
              terprise: keyword and specifies that only vendorclasses matching the specified number should be searched.

       -j, --dhcp-userclass=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;user-class&gt;
              Map from a user-class string to a tag (with substring matching, like vendor classes). Most  DHCP  clients  provide  a
              "user  class"  which  is configurable. This option maps user classes to tags, so that DHCP options may be selectively
              delivered to different classes of hosts. It is possible, for instance to use this to set a different  printer  server
              for hosts in the class "accounts" than for hosts in the class "engineering".

       -4, --dhcp-mac=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;MAC address&gt;
              Map   from   a   MAC   address   to   a   tag.   The   MAC   address  may  include  wildcards.  For  example  --dhcp-
              mac=set:3com,01:34:23:*:*:* will set the tag "3com" for any host whose MAC address matches the pattern.

       --dhcp-circuitid=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;circuit-id&gt;, --dhcp-remoteid=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;remote-id&gt;
              Map from RFC3046 relay agent options to tags. This data may be provided by DHCP relay agents. The circuit-id  or  re‐
              mote-id  is  normally  given  as colon-separated hex, but is also allowed to be a simple string. If an exact match is
              achieved between the circuit or agent ID and one provided by a relay agent, the tag is set.

              --dhcp-remoteid (but not --dhcp-circuitid) is supported in IPv6.

       --dhcp-subscrid=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;subscriber-id&gt;
              (IPv4 and IPv6) Map from RFC3993 subscriber-id relay agent options to tags.

       --dhcp-proxy[=&lt;ip addr&gt;]......
              (IPv4 only) A normal DHCP relay agent is only used to forward the initial parts of a DHCP  interaction  to  the  DHCP
              server. Once a client is configured, it communicates directly with the server. This is undesirable if the relay agent
              is adding extra information to the DHCP packets, such as that used by --dhcp-circuitid and --dhcp-remoteid.   A  full
              relay  implementation  can  use  the RFC 5107 serverid-override option to force the DHCP server to use the relay as a
              full proxy, with all packets passing through it. This flag provides an alternative method of doing  the  same  thing,
              for  relays  which don't support RFC 5107. Given alone, it manipulates the server-id for all interactions via relays.
              If a list of IP addresses is given, only interactions via relays at those addresses are affected.

       --dhcp-match=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;option number&gt;|option:&lt;option name&gt;|vi-encap:&lt;enterprise&gt;[,&lt;value&gt;]
              Without a value, set the tag if the client sends a DHCP option of the given number or name. When a  value  is  given,
              set the tag only if the option is sent and matches the value. The value may be of the form "01:ff:*:02" in which case
              the value must match (apart from wildcards) but the option sent may have unmatched data past the end  of  the  value.
              The  value may also be of the same form as in --dhcp-option in which case the option sent is treated as an array, and
              one element must match, so --dhcp-match=set:efi-ia32,option:client-arch,6 will set the tag "efi-ia32" if the the num‐
              ber 6 appears in the list of architectures sent by the client in option 93. (See RFC 4578 for details.)  If the value
              is a string, substring matching is used.

              The special form with vi-encap:&lt;enterprise number&gt; matches against vendor-identifying vendor classes for  the  speci‐
              fied enterprise. Please see RFC 3925 for more details of these rare and interesting beasts.

       --dhcp-name-match=set:&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;name&gt;[*]
              Set  the tag if the given name is supplied by a DHCP client. There may be a single trailing wildcard *, which has the
              usual meaning. Combined with dhcp-ignore or dhcp-ignore-names this gives the ability to  ignore  certain  clients  by
              name, or disallow certain hostnames from being claimed by a client.

       --tag-if=set:&lt;tag&gt;[,set:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]]]
              Perform  boolean  operations on tags. Any tag appearing as set:&lt;tag&gt; is set if all the tags which appear as tag:&lt;tag&gt;
              are set, (or unset when tag:!&lt;tag&gt; is used) If no tag:&lt;tag&gt; appears set:&lt;tag&gt; tags are set unconditionally.  Any num‐
              ber  of  set:  and  tag:  forms  may  appear,  in  any order.  --tag-if lines are executed in order, so if the tag in
              tag:&lt;tag&gt; is a tag set by another --tag-if, the line which sets the tag must precede the one which tests it.

              As an extension, the tag:&lt;tag&gt; clauses support limited wildcard matching, similar to the matching in the  --interface
              directive.   This allows, for example, using --tag-if=set:ppp,tag:ppp* to set the tag 'ppp' for all requests received
              on any matching interface (ppp0, ppp1, etc).  This can be used in conjunction with the tag:!&lt;tag&gt; format meaning that
              no tag matching the wildcard may be set.

       -J, --dhcp-ignore=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]
              When all the given tags appear in the tag set ignore the host and do not allocate it a DHCP lease.

       --dhcp-ignore-names[=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]]
              When all the given tags appear in the tag set, ignore any hostname provided by the host. Note that, unlike --dhcp-ig‐
              nore, it is permissible to supply no tags, in which case DHCP-client supplied hostnames are always ignored, and  DHCP
              hosts  are  added  to  the  DNS  using  only  --dhcp-host configuration in dnsmasq and the contents of /etc/hosts and
              /etc/ethers.

       --dhcp-generate-names=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]
              (IPv4 only) Generate a name for DHCP clients which do not otherwise have one, using the MAC address expressed in hex,
              separated  by  dashes.  Note that if a host provides a name, it will be used by preference to this, unless --dhcp-ig‐
              nore-names is set.

       --dhcp-broadcast[=tag:&lt;tag&gt;[,tag:&lt;tag&gt;]]
              (IPv4 only) When all the given tags appear in the tag set, always use broadcast to communicate with the host when  it
              is  unconfigured.  It  is permissible to supply no tags, in which case this is unconditional. Most DHCP clients which
              need broadcast replies set a flag in their requests so that this happens automatically, some  old  BOOTP  clients  do
              not.

       -M, --dhcp-boot=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;filename&gt;,[&lt;servername&gt;[,&lt;server address&gt;|&lt;tftp_servername&gt;]]
              (IPv4  only)  Set  BOOTP options to be returned by the DHCP server. Server name and address are optional: if not pro‐
              vided, the name is left empty, and the address set to the address of the machine running dnsmasq. If dnsmasq is  pro‐
              viding a TFTP service (see --enable-tftp ) then only the filename is required here to enable network booting.  If the
              optional tag(s) are given, they must match for this configuration to be sent.  Instead of an  IP  address,  the  TFTP
              server  address  can  be  given  as  a  domain  name which is looked up in /etc/hosts. This name can be associated in
              /etc/hosts with multiple IP addresses, which are used round-robin.  This facility can be used  to  load  balance  the
              tftp load among a set of servers.

       --dhcp-sequential-ip
              Dnsmasq  is  designed to choose IP addresses for DHCP clients using a hash of the client's MAC address. This normally
              allows a client's address to remain stable long-term, even if the client  sometimes allows its DHCP lease to  expire.
              In  this default mode IP addresses are distributed pseudo-randomly over the entire available address range. There are
              sometimes circumstances (typically server deployment) where it is more convenient to have IP addresses allocated  se‐
              quentially, starting from the lowest available address, and setting this flag enables this mode. Note that in the se‐
              quential mode, clients which allow a lease to expire are much more likely to move IP  address;  for  this  reason  it
              should not be generally used.

       --dhcp-ignore-clid
              Dnsmasq is reading 'client identifier' (RFC 2131) option sent by clients (if available) to identify clients. This al‐
              low to serve same IP address for a host using several interfaces. Use this  option  to  disable  'client  identifier'
              reading, i.e. to always identify a host using the MAC address.

       --pxe-service=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;CSA&gt;,&lt;menu text&gt;[,&lt;basename&gt;|&lt;bootservicetype&gt;][,&lt;server address&gt;|&lt;server_name&gt;]
              Most  uses  of PXE boot-ROMS simply allow the PXE system to obtain an IP address and then download the file specified
              by --dhcp-boot and execute it. However the PXE system is capable of more complex functions when supported by a  suit‐
              able DHCP server.

              This  specifies  a boot option which may appear in a PXE boot menu. &lt;CSA&gt; is client system type, only services of the
              correct type will appear in a menu. The known types are x86PC, PC98,  IA64_EFI,  Alpha,  Arc_x86,  Intel_Lean_Client,
              IA32_EFI,   x86-64_EFI,  Xscale_EFI, BC_EFI, ARM32_EFI and ARM64_EFI; an integer may be used for other types. The pa‐
              rameter after the menu text may be a file name, in which case dnsmasq acts as a  boot  server  and  directs  the  PXE
              client to download the file by TFTP, either from itself ( --enable-tftp must be set for this to work) or another TFTP
              server if the final server address/name is given.  Note that the "layer" suffix (normally ".0") is supplied  by  PXE,
              and  need not be added to the basename. Alternatively, the basename may be a filename, complete with suffix, in which
              case no layer suffix is added. If an integer boot service type, rather than a basename is given, then the PXE  client
              will search for a suitable boot service for that type on the network. This search may be done by broadcast, or direct
              to a server if its IP address/name is provided.  If no boot service type or filename is provided (or a  boot  service
              type  of 0 is specified) then the menu entry will abort the net boot procedure and continue booting from local media.
              The server address can be given as a domain name which is looked up in /etc/hosts. This name  can  be  associated  in
              /etc/hosts with multiple IP addresses, which are used round-robin.

       --pxe-prompt=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;prompt&gt;[,&lt;timeout&gt;]
              Setting  this  provides  a  prompt to be displayed after PXE boot. If the timeout is given then after the timeout has
              elapsed with no keyboard input, the first available menu option will be automatically executed.  If  the  timeout  is
              zero then the first available menu item will be executed immediately. If --pxe-prompt is omitted the system will wait
              for user input if there are multiple items in the menu, but boot immediately if there is only one. See  --pxe-service
              for details of menu items.

              Dnsmasq  supports  PXE "proxy-DHCP", in this case another DHCP server on the network is responsible for allocating IP
              addresses, and dnsmasq simply provides the information given in --pxe-prompt and --pxe-service to  allow  netbooting.
              This mode is enabled using the proxy keyword in --dhcp-range.

       --dhcp-pxe-vendor=&lt;vendor&gt;[,...]
              According  to  UEFI  and  PXE specifications, DHCP packets between PXE clients and proxy PXE servers should have PXE‐
              Client in their vendor-class field. However, the firmware of computers from a few vendors is customized  to  carry  a
              different  identifier  in  that  field.  This  option  is used to consider such identifiers valid for identifying PXE
              clients. For instance

              --dhcp-pxe-vendor=PXEClient,HW-Client

              will enable dnsmasq to also provide proxy PXE service to those PXE clients with HW-Client in as their identifier.

       -X, --dhcp-lease-max=&lt;number&gt;
              Limits dnsmasq to the specified maximum number of DHCP leases. The default is 1000. This limit is to prevent DoS  at‐
              tacks from hosts which create thousands of leases and use lots of memory in the dnsmasq process.

       -K, --dhcp-authoritative
              Should  be  set  when  dnsmasq is definitely the only DHCP server on a network.  For DHCPv4, it changes the behaviour
              from strict RFC compliance so that DHCP requests on unknown leases from unknown hosts are not  ignored.  This  allows
              new  hosts  to  get  a lease without a tedious timeout under all circumstances. It also allows dnsmasq to rebuild its
              lease database without each client needing to reacquire a lease, if the database is lost. For DHCPv6 it sets the pri‐
              ority in replies to 255 (the maximum) instead of 0 (the minimum).

       --dhcp-rapid-commit
              Enable DHCPv4 Rapid Commit Option specified in RFC 4039. When enabled, dnsmasq will respond to a DHCPDISCOVER message
              including a Rapid Commit option with a DHCPACK including a Rapid Commit option and fully committed address  and  con‐
              figuration  information.  Should only be enabled if either the server is  the only server for the subnet, or multiple
              servers are present and they each commit a binding for all clients.

       --dhcp-alternate-port[=&lt;server port&gt;[,&lt;client port&gt;]]
              (IPv4 only) Change the ports used for DHCP from the default. If this option is given  alone,  without  arguments,  it
              changes  the  ports used for DHCP from 67 and 68 to 1067 and 1068. If a single argument is given, that port number is
              used for the server and the port number plus one used for the client. Finally,  two  port  numbers  allows  arbitrary
              specification of both server and client ports for DHCP.

       -3, --bootp-dynamic[=&lt;network-id&gt;[,&lt;network-id&gt;]]
              (IPv4  only) Enable dynamic allocation of IP addresses to BOOTP clients. Use this with care, since each address allo‐
              cated to a BOOTP client is leased forever, and therefore becomes permanently unavailable for re-use by  other  hosts.
              if  this is given without tags, then it unconditionally enables dynamic allocation. With tags, only when the tags are
              all set. It may be repeated with different tag sets.

       -5, --no-ping
              (IPv4 only) By default, the DHCP server will attempt to ensure that an address is not in use before allocating it  to
              a  host.  It  does  this by sending an ICMP echo request (aka "ping") to the address in question. If it gets a reply,
              then the address must already be in use, and another is tried. This flag disables this check. Use with caution.

       --log-dhcp
              Extra logging for DHCP: log all the options sent to DHCP clients and the tags used to determine them.

       --quiet-dhcp, --quiet-dhcp6, --quiet-ra, --quiet-tftp
              Suppress logging of the routine operation of these protocols. Errors and problems will still be logged.  --quiet-tftp
              does not consider file not found to be an error. --quiet-dhcp and quiet-dhcp6 are over-ridden by --log-dhcp.

       -l, --dhcp-leasefile=&lt;path&gt;
              Use the specified file to store DHCP lease information.

       --dhcp-duid=&lt;enterprise-id&gt;,&lt;uid&gt;
              (IPv6  only) Specify the server persistent UID which the DHCPv6 server will use. This option is not normally required
              as dnsmasq creates a DUID automatically when it is first needed. When given, this option provides  dnsmasq  the  data
              required  to  create  a DUID-EN type DUID. Note that once set, the DUID is stored in the lease database, so to change
              between DUID-EN and automatically created DUIDs or vice-versa, the lease database must be re-initialised. The  enter‐
              prise-id is assigned by IANA, and the uid is a string of hex octets unique to a particular device.

       -6 --dhcp-script=&lt;path&gt;
              Whenever  a  new  DHCP  lease  is created, or an old one destroyed, or a TFTP file transfer completes, the executable
              specified by this option is run.  &lt;path&gt; must be an absolute pathname, no PATH search occurs.  The arguments  to  the
              process are "add", "old" or "del", the MAC address of the host (or DUID for IPv6) , the IP address, and the hostname,
              if known. "add" means a lease has been created, "del" means it has been destroyed, "old" is a notification of an  ex‐
              isting  lease  when dnsmasq starts or a change to MAC address or hostname of an existing lease (also, lease length or
              expiry and client-id, if --leasefile-ro is set and lease expiry if --script-on-renewal is set).  If the  MAC  address
              is  from  a  network type other than ethernet, it will have the network type prepended, eg "06-01:23:45:67:89:ab" for
              token ring. The process is run as root (assuming that dnsmasq was originally run as root) even if dnsmasq is  config‐
              ured to change UID to an unprivileged user.

              The environment is inherited from the invoker of dnsmasq, with some or all of the following variables added

              For both IPv4 and IPv6:

              DNSMASQ_DOMAIN  if  the fully-qualified domain name of the host is known, this is set to the  domain part. (Note that
              the hostname passed to the script as an argument is never fully-qualified.)

              If the client provides a hostname, DNSMASQ_SUPPLIED_HOSTNAME

              If the client provides user-classes, DNSMASQ_USER_CLASS0..DNSMASQ_USER_CLASSn

              If dnsmasq was compiled with HAVE_BROKEN_RTC,  then  the  length  of  the  lease  (in  seconds)  is  stored  in  DNS‐
              MASQ_LEASE_LENGTH, otherwise the time of lease expiry is stored in DNSMASQ_LEASE_EXPIRES. The number of seconds until
              lease expiry is always stored in DNSMASQ_TIME_REMAINING.

              DNSMASQ_DATA_MISSING is set to "1" during "old" events for existing leases generated at startup to indicate that data
              not  stored  in  the  persistent lease database will not be present. This comprises everything other than IP address,
              hostname, MAC address, DUID, IAID and lease length or expiry time.

              If a lease used to have a hostname, which is removed, an "old" event is generated with the new state of the lease, ie
              no name, and the former name is provided in the environment variable DNSMASQ_OLD_HOSTNAME.

              DNSMASQ_INTERFACE  stores  the  name of the interface on which the request arrived; this is not set for "old" actions
              when dnsmasq restarts.

              DNSMASQ_RELAY_ADDRESS is set if the client used a DHCP relay to contact dnsmasq and the IP address of  the  relay  is
              known.

              DNSMASQ_TAGS contains all the tags set during the DHCP transaction, separated by spaces.

              DNSMASQ_LOG_DHCP is set if --log-dhcp is in effect.

              DNSMASQ_REQUESTED_OPTIONS  a  string  containing the decimal values in the Parameter Request List option, comma sepa‐
              rated, if the parameter request list option is provided by the client.

              DNSMASQ_MUD_URL the Manufacturer Usage Description URL if provided by the client. (See RFC8520 for details.)

              For IPv4 only:

              DNSMASQ_CLIENT_ID if the host provided a client-id.

              DNSMASQ_CIRCUIT_ID, DNSMASQ_SUBSCRIBER_ID, DNSMASQ_REMOTE_ID if a DHCP relay-agent added any of these options.

              If the client provides vendor-class, DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS.

              For IPv6 only:

              If the client provides vendor-class, DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS_ID, containing the IANA enterprise id for  the  class,  and
              DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASS0..DNSMASQ_VENDOR_CLASSn for the data.

              DNSMASQ_SERVER_DUID containing the DUID of the server: this is the same for every call to the script.

              DNSMASQ_IAID containing the IAID for the lease. If the lease is a temporary allocation, this is prefixed to 'T'.

              DNSMASQ_MAC containing the MAC address of the client, if known.

              Note  that the supplied hostname, vendorclass and userclass data is only  supplied for "add" actions or "old" actions
              when a host resumes an existing lease, since these data are not held in dnsmasq's lease database.

              All file descriptors are closed except stdin, which is open to /dev/null, and stdout and stderr which capture  output
              for  logging  by dnsmasq.  (In debug mode, stdio, stdout and stderr file are left as those inherited from the invoker
              of dnsmasq).

              The script is not invoked concurrently: at most one instance of the script is ever running (dnsmasq waits for an  in‐
              stance  of  script to exit before running the next). Changes to the lease database are which require the script to be
              invoked are queued awaiting exit of a running instance.  If this queueing allows multiple state changes  occur  to  a
              single  lease  before  the script can be run then earlier states are discarded and the current state of that lease is
              reflected when the script finally runs.

              At dnsmasq startup, the script will be invoked for all existing leases as they are read from the lease file.  Expired
              leases  will  be  called with "del" and others with "old". When dnsmasq receives a HUP signal, the script will be in‐
              voked for existing leases with an "old" event.

              There are five further actions which may appear as the first argument to the script,  "init",  "arp-add",  "arp-del",
              "relay-snoop"  and  "tftp".  More may be added in the future, so scripts should be written to ignore unknown actions.
              "init" is described below in --leasefile-ro

              The "tftp" action is invoked when a TFTP file transfer completes: the arguments are the file size in bytes,  the  ad‐
              dress to which the file was sent, and the complete pathname of the file.

              The "relay-snoop" action is invoked when dnsmasq is configured as a DHCP relay for DHCPv6 and it relays a prefx dele‐
              gation to a client. The arguments are the name of the interface where the client is conected,  its  (link-local)  ad‐
              dress  on  that interface and the delegated prefix. This information is sufficient to install routes to the delegated
              prefix of a router. See --dhcp-relay for more details on configuring DHCP relay.

              The "arp-add" and "arp-del" actions are only called if enabled with --script-arp They are are supplied with a MAC ad‐
              dress  and IP address as arguments. "arp-add" indicates the arrival of a new entry in the ARP or neighbour table, and
              "arp-del" indicates the deletion of same.

       --dhcp-luascript=&lt;path&gt;
              Specify a script written in Lua, to be run when leases are created, destroyed or changed. To use this option, dnsmasq
              must  be  compiled  with  the  correct support. The Lua interpreter is initialised once, when dnsmasq starts, so that
              global variables persist between lease events. The Lua code must define a lease function, and may  provide  init  and
              shutdown  functions, which are called, without arguments when dnsmasq starts up and terminates. It may also provide a
              tftp function.

              The lease function receives the information detailed in --dhcp-script.  It gets two arguments,  firstly  the  action,
              which  is a string containing, "add", "old" or "del", and secondly a table of tag value pairs. The tags mostly corre‐
              spond to the environment variables detailed above, for instance the tag "domain" holds the same data as the  environ‐
              ment  variable DNSMASQ_DOMAIN. There are a few extra tags which hold the data supplied as arguments to --dhcp-script.
              These are mac_address, ip_address and hostname for IPv4, and client_duid, ip_address and hostname for IPv6.

              The tftp function is called in the same way as the lease function, and the table holds the tags  destination_address,
              file_name and file_size.

              The  arp  and  arp-old functions are called only when enabled with --script-arp and have a table which holds the tags
              mac_address and client_address.

       --dhcp-scriptuser
              Specify the user as which to run the lease-change script or Lua script. This defaults to root, but can be changed  to
              another user using this flag.

       --script-arp
              Enable the "arp" and "arp-old" functions in the --dhcp-script and --dhcp-luascript.

       -9, --leasefile-ro
              Completely  suppress  use  of the lease database file. The file will not be created, read, or written. Change the way
              the lease-change script (if one is provided) is called, so that the lease database  may  be  maintained  in  external
              storage by the script. In addition to the invocations  given in --dhcp-script the lease-change script is called once,
              at dnsmasq startup, with the single argument "init". When called like this the script should write the saved state of
              the  lease  database,  in  dnsmasq leasefile format, to stdout and exit with zero exit code. Setting this option also
              forces the leasechange script to be called on changes to the client-id and lease length and expiry time.

       --script-on-renewal
              Call the DHCP script when the lease expiry time changes, for instance when the lease is renewed.

       --bridge-interface=&lt;interface&gt;,&lt;alias&gt;[,&lt;alias&gt;]
              Treat DHCP (v4 and v6) requests and IPv6 Router Solicit packets arriving at any of the &lt;alias&gt; interfaces as if  they
              had arrived at &lt;interface&gt;.  This option allows dnsmasq to provide DHCP and RA service over unaddressed and unbridged
              Ethernet interfaces, e.g. on an OpenStack compute host where each such interface is a TAP interface to a VM, or as in
              "old style bridging" on BSD platforms.  A trailing '*' wildcard can be used in each &lt;alias&gt;.

              It  is  permissible  to  add  more than one alias using more than one --bridge-interface option since --bridge-inter‐
              face=int1,alias1,alias2 is exactly equivalent to --bridge-interface=int1,alias1 --bridge-interface=int1,alias2

       --shared-network=&lt;interface&gt;,&lt;addr&gt;
       --shared-network=&lt;addr&gt;,&lt;addr&gt;
              The DHCP server determines which DHCP ranges are useable for allocating an address to a DHCP client based on the net‐
              work  from  which  the  DHCP request arrives, and the IP configuration of the server's interface on that network. The
              shared-network option extends the available subnets (and therefore DHCP ranges) beyond the subnets configured on  the
              arrival interface.

              The first argument is either the name of an interface, or an address that is configured on a local interface, and the
              second argument is an address which defines another subnet on which addresses can be allocated.

              To be useful, there must be a suitable dhcp-range which allows address allocation on this subnet and this  dhcp-range
              MUST include the netmask.

              Using  shared-network  also needs extra consideration of routing. Dnsmasq does not have the usual information that it
              uses to determine the default route, so the default route option (or other routing) MUST be configured manually.  The
              client  must  have  a route to the server: if the two-address form of shared-network is used, this needs to be to the
              first specified address. If the interface,address form is used, there must be a route to all of the addresses config‐
              ured on the interface.

              The  two-address form of shared-network is also usable with a DHCP relay: the first address is the address of the re‐
              lay and the second, as before, specifies an extra subnet which addresses may be allocated from.

       -s, --domain=&lt;domain&gt;[[,&lt;address range&gt;[,local]]|&lt;interface&gt;]
              Specifies DNS domains for the DHCP server. Domains may be be given unconditionally (without the IP range) or for lim‐
              ited  IP  ranges. This has two effects; firstly it causes the DHCP server to return the domain to any hosts which re‐
              quest it, and secondly it sets the domain which it is legal for DHCP-configured hosts to claim. The intention  is  to
              constrain  hostnames  so that an untrusted host on the LAN cannot advertise its name via DHCP as e.g. "microsoft.com"
              and capture traffic not meant for it. If no domain suffix is specified, then any DHCP hostname with a domain part (ie
              with  a period) will be disallowed and logged. If suffix is specified, then hostnames with a domain part are allowed,
              provided the domain part matches the suffix. In addition, when a suffix is set then hostnames without a  domain  part
              have  the  suffix  added as an optional domain part. Eg on my network I can set --domain=thekelleys.org.uk and have a
              machine whose DHCP hostname is "laptop". The IP address for that machine is available from dnsmasq both  as  "laptop"
              and  "laptop.thekelleys.org.uk". If the domain is given as "#" then the domain is read from the first "search" direc‐
              tive in /etc/resolv.conf (or equivalent).

              The address range can be of the form &lt;ip address&gt;,&lt;ip address&gt; or &lt;ip address&gt;/&lt;netmask&gt; or just  a  single  &lt;ip  ad‐
              dress&gt;. See --dhcp-fqdn which can change the behaviour of dnsmasq with domains.

              If  the  address  range is given as ip-address/network-size, then a additional flag "local" may be supplied which has
              the  effect  of  adding  --local  declarations  for  forward  and  reverse   DNS   queries.   Eg.    --domain=thekel‐
              leys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24,local   is   identical   to   --domain=thekelleys.org.uk,192.168.0.0/24   --local=/thekel‐
              leys.org.uk/ --local=/0.168.192.in-addr.arpa/

              The address range can also be given as a network interface name, in which case all of the subnets currently  assigned
              to  the  interface are used in matching the address. This allows hosts on different physical subnets to be given dif‐
              ferent domains in a way which updates automatically as the interface addresses change.

       --dhcp-fqdn
              In the default mode, dnsmasq inserts the unqualified names of DHCP clients into the DNS. For this reason,  the  names
              must  be  unique,  even if two clients which have the same name are in different domains. If a second DHCP client ap‐
              pears which has the same name as an existing client, the name is transferred to the new  client.  If  --dhcp-fqdn  is
              set,  this  behaviour  changes:  the  unqualified name is no longer put in the DNS, only the qualified name. Two DHCP
              clients with the same name may both keep the name, provided that the domain part is different (ie the fully qualified
              names differ.) To ensure that all names have a domain part, there must be at least --domain without an address speci‐
              fied when --dhcp-fqdn is set.

       --dhcp-client-update
              Normally, when giving a DHCP lease, dnsmasq sets flags in the FQDN option to tell the client not to  attempt  a  DDNS
              update with its name and IP address. This is because the name-IP pair is automatically added into dnsmasq's DNS view.
              This flag suppresses that behaviour, this is useful, for instance, to allow Windows clients to update  Active  Direc‐
              tory servers. See RFC 4702 for details.

       --enable-ra
              Enable  dnsmasq's IPv6 Router Advertisement feature. DHCPv6 doesn't handle complete network configuration in the same
              way as DHCPv4. Router discovery and (possibly) prefix discovery for autonomous address creation are handled by a dif‐
              ferent protocol. When DHCP is in use, only a subset of this is needed, and dnsmasq can handle it, using existing DHCP
              configuration to provide most data. When RA is enabled, dnsmasq will advertise a prefix for each  --dhcp-range,  with
              default  router  as the relevant link-local address on the machine running dnsmasq. By default, the "managed address"
              bits are set, and the "use SLAAC" bit is reset. This can be changed for individual subnets with the mode keywords de‐
              scribed  in  --dhcp-range.  RFC6106 DNS parameters are included in the advertisements. By default, the relevant link-
              local address of the machine running dnsmasq is sent as recursive DNS server. If provided, the  DHCPv6  options  dns-
              server and domain-search are used for the DNS server (RDNSS) and the domain search list (DNSSL).

       --ra-param=&lt;interface&gt;,[mtu:&lt;integer&gt;|&lt;interface&gt;|off,][high,|low,]&lt;ra-interval&gt;[,&lt;router lifetime&gt;]
              Set  non-default values for router advertisements sent via an interface. The priority field for the router may be al‐
              tered from the default of medium with eg --ra-param=eth0,high.  The interval between router advertisements may be set
              (in seconds) with --ra-param=eth0,60.  The lifetime of the route may be changed or set to zero, which allows a router
              to advertise prefixes but not a route via itself.  --ra-param=eth0,0,0 (A value of zero for the  interval  means  the
              default value.) All four parameters may be set at once.  --ra-param=eth0,mtu:1280,low,60,1200

              The interface field may include a wildcard.

              The  mtu:  parameter may be an arbitrary interface name, in which case the MTU value for that interface is used. This
              is useful for (eg) advertising the MTU of a WAN interface on the other interfaces of a router.

       --dhcp-reply-delay=[tag:&lt;tag&gt;,]&lt;integer&gt;
              Delays sending DHCPOFFER and PROXYDHCP replies for at least the specified number of seconds.  This  can  be  used  as
              workaround  for  bugs in PXE boot firmware that does not function properly when receiving an instant reply.  This op‐
              tion takes into account the time already spent waiting (e.g. performing ping check) if any.

       --enable-tftp[=&lt;interface&gt;[,&lt;interface&gt;]]
              Enable the TFTP server function. This is deliberately limited to that needed to net-boot a client.  Only  reading  is
              allowed; the tsize and blksize extensions are supported (tsize is only supported in octet mode). Without an argument,
              the TFTP service is provided to the same set of interfaces as DHCP service.  If the list of interfaces  is  provided,
              that defines which interfaces receive TFTP service.

       --tftp-root=&lt;directory&gt;[,&lt;interface&gt;]
              Look  for  files  to  transfer using TFTP relative to the given directory. When this is set, TFTP paths which include
              ".." are rejected, to stop clients getting outside the specified root.  Absolute paths (starting with /) are allowed,
              but  they  must  be within the tftp-root. If the optional interface argument is given, the directory is only used for
              TFTP requests via that interface.

       --tftp-no-fail
              Do not abort startup if specified tftp root directories are inaccessible.

       --tftp-unique-root[=ip|mac]
              Add the IP or hardware address of the TFTP client as a path component on the end of the TFTP-root. Only  valid  if  a
              --tftp-root  is  set  and the directory exists.  Defaults to adding IP address (in standard dotted-quad format).  For
              instance, if --tftp-root is "/tftp" and client 1.2.3.4 requests  file  "myfile"  then  the  effective  path  will  be
              "/tftp/1.2.3.4/myfile"  if  /tftp/1.2.3.4  exists or /tftp/myfile otherwise.  When "=mac" is specified it will append
              the MAC address instead, using lowercase zero padded digits separated by dashes, e.g.:  01-02-03-04-aa-bb  Note  that
              resolving MAC addresses is only possible if the client is in the local network or obtained a DHCP lease from us.

       --tftp-secure
              Enable  TFTP  secure  mode: without this, any file which is readable by the dnsmasq process under normal unix access-
              control rules is available via TFTP. When the --tftp-secure flag is given, only files owned by the user  running  the
              dnsmasq  process are accessible. If dnsmasq is being run as root, different rules apply: --tftp-secure has no effect,
              but only files which have the world-readable bit set are accessible. It is not recommended to  run  dnsmasq  as  root
              with  TFTP  enabled, and certainly not without specifying --tftp-root. Doing so can expose any world-readable file on
              the server to any host on the net.

       --tftp-lowercase
              Convert filenames in TFTP requests to all lowercase. This is useful for requests from Windows  machines,  which  have
              case-insensitive filesystems and tend to play fast-and-loose with case in filenames.  Note that dnsmasq's tftp server
              always converts "\" to "/" in filenames.

       --tftp-max=&lt;connections&gt;
              Set the maximum number of concurrent TFTP connections allowed. This defaults to 50. When serving a  large  number  of
              TFTP  connections,  per-process file descriptor limits may be encountered. Dnsmasq needs one file descriptor for each
              concurrent TFTP connection and one file descriptor per unique file (plus a few others). So serving the same file  si‐
              multaneously to n clients will use require about n + 10 file descriptors, serving different files simultaneously to n
              clients will require about (2*n) + 10 descriptors. If --tftp-port-range is given, that can affect the number of  con‐
              current connections.

       --tftp-mtu=&lt;mtu size&gt;
              Use  size  as the ceiling of the MTU supported by the intervening network when negotiating TFTP blocksize, overriding
              the MTU setting of the local interface  if it is larger.

       --tftp-no-blocksize
              Stop the TFTP server from negotiating the "blocksize" option with a client. Some buggy clients  request  this  option
              but then behave badly when it is granted.

       --tftp-port-range=&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;
              A  TFTP  server listens on a well-known port (69) for connection initiation, but it also uses a dynamically-allocated
              port for each connection. Normally these are allocated by the OS, but this option specifies a range of ports for  use
              by  TFTP  transfers.  This can be useful when TFTP has to traverse a firewall. The start of the range cannot be lower
              than 1025 unless dnsmasq is running as root. The number of concurrent TFTP connections is limited by the size of  the
              port range.

       --tftp-single-port
              Run  in a mode where the TFTP server uses ONLY the well-known port (69) for its end of the TFTP transfer. This allows
              TFTP to work when there in NAT is the path between client and server. Note that this is not strictly  compliant  with
              the RFCs specifying the TFTP protocol: use at your own risk.

       -C, --conf-file=&lt;file&gt;
              Specify  a  configuration file. The presence of this option stops dnsmasq from reading the default configuration file
              (normally /etc/dnsmasq.conf). Multiple files may be specified by repeating the option either on the command  line  or
              in configuration files. A filename of "-" causes dnsmasq to read configuration from stdin.

       -7, --conf-dir=&lt;directory&gt;[,&lt;file-extension&gt;......],
              Read  all  the files in the given directory as configuration files. If extension(s) are given, any files which end in
              those extensions are skipped. Any files whose names end in ~ or start with . or start  and  end  with  #  are  always
              skipped.  If  the  extension  starts  with  *  then  only  files  which  have  that  extension are loaded. So --conf-
              dir=/path/to/dir,*.conf loads all files with the suffix .conf in /path/to/dir. This flag may be given on the  command
              line  or  in a configuration file. If giving it on the command line, be sure to escape * characters. Files are loaded
              in alphabetical order of filename.

       --servers-file=&lt;file&gt;
              A special case of --conf-file which differs in two respects. Firstly, only --server and --rev-server are  allowed  in
              the  configuration file included. Secondly, the file is re-read and the configuration therein is updated when dnsmasq
              receives SIGHUP.

       --conf-script=&lt;file&gt;[ &lt;arg]
              Execute &lt;file&gt;, and treat what it emits to stdout as the contents of a configuration file.  If the script exits  with
              a non-zero exit code, dnsmasq treats this as a fatal error.  The script can be passed arguments, space seperated from
              the filename and each other so, for instance --conf-dir="/etc/dnsmasq-uncompress-ads /share/ads-domains.gz"

              with /etc/dnsmasq-uncompress-ads containing

              set -e

              zcat ${1} | sed -e "s:^:address=/:" -e "s:$:/:"

              exit 0

              and /share/ads-domains.gz containing a compressed list of ad server domains will save disk space with large ad-server
              blocklists.

       --no-ident
              Do not respond to class CHAOS and type TXT in domain bind queries.

              Without  this  option  being  set,  the cache statistics are also available in the DNS as answers to queries of class
              CHAOS and type TXT in domain bind. The domain names are cachesize.bind, insertions.bind, evictions.bind, misses.bind,
              hits.bind,  auth.bind  and  servers.bind unless disabled at compile-time. An example command to query this, using the
              dig utility would be

       At startup, dnsmasq reads /etc/dnsmasq.conf, if it exists. (On FreeBSD, the file is /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf )  (but  see
       the  --conf-file  and  --conf-dir options.) The format of this file consists of one option per line, exactly as the long op‐
       tions detailed in the OPTIONS section but without the leading "--". Lines starting with # are comments and ignored. For  op‐
       tions  which  may only be specified once, the configuration file overrides the command line.  Quoting is allowed in a config
       file: between " quotes the special meanings of ,:. and # are removed and the following escapes are allowed: \\ \" \t  \e  \b
       \r and \n. The later corresponding to tab, escape, backspace, return and newline.

NOTES
       When  it  receives  a  SIGHUP,  dnsmasq  clears its cache and then re-loads /etc/hosts and /etc/ethers and any file given by
       --dhcp-hostsfile, --dhcp-hostsdir, --dhcp-optsfile, --dhcp-optsdir, --addn-hosts  or  --hostsdir.   The  DHCP  lease  change
       script  is  called for all existing DHCP leases. If --no-poll is set SIGHUP also re-reads /etc/resolv.conf.  SIGHUP does NOT
       re-read the configuration file.

       When it receives a SIGUSR1, dnsmasq writes statistics to the system log. It writes the cache size, the number of names which
       have  had  to  removed  from the cache before they expired in order to make room for new names and the total number of names
       that have been inserted into the cache. The number of cache hits and misses and the number of authoritative queries answered
       are  also given. For each upstream server it gives the number of queries sent, and the number which resulted in an error. In
       --no-daemon mode or when full logging is enabled (--log-queries), a complete dump of the contents of the cache is made.

       When it receives SIGUSR2 and it is logging direct to a file (see --log-facility ) dnsmasq will  close  and  reopen  the  log
       file.  Note  that  during  this  operation,  dnsmasq  will not be running as root. When it first creates the logfile dnsmasq
       changes the ownership of the file to the non-root user it will run as. Logrotate should be configured to create  a  new  log
       file  with the ownership which matches the existing one before sending SIGUSR2.  If TCP DNS queries are in progress, the old
       logfile will remain open in child processes which are handling TCP queries and may continue to be written. There is a  limit
       of  150 seconds, after which all existing TCP processes will have expired: for this reason, it is not wise to configure log‐
       file compression for logfiles which have just been rotated. Using logrotate, the required  options  are  create  and  delay‐
       compress.

       Dnsmasq  is  a  DNS  query  forwarder:  it  is not capable of recursively answering arbitrary queries starting from the root
       servers but forwards such queries to a fully recursive upstream DNS server which is typically provided by  an  ISP.  By  de‐
       fault,  dnsmasq reads /etc/resolv.conf to discover the IP addresses of the upstream nameservers it should use, since the in‐
       formation is typically stored there. Unless --no-poll is used, dnsmasq checks the modification time of /etc/resolv.conf  (or
       equivalent if --resolv-file is used) and re-reads it if it changes. This allows the DNS servers to be set dynamically by PPP
       or DHCP since both protocols provide the information.  Absence of /etc/resolv.conf is not an error since  it  may  not  have
       been  created before a PPP connection exists. Dnsmasq simply keeps checking in case /etc/resolv.conf is created at any time.
       Dnsmasq can be told to parse more than one resolv.conf file. This is useful on a laptop, where both  PPP  and  DHCP  may  be
       used: dnsmasq can be set to poll both /etc/ppp/resolv.conf and /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf and will use the contents of whichever
       changed last, giving automatic switching between DNS servers.

       Upstream servers may also be specified on the command line or in the configuration file. These server specifications option‐
       ally take a domain name which tells dnsmasq to use that server only to find names in that particular domain.

       In  order  to  configure dnsmasq to act as cache for the host on which it is running, put "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in /etc/re‐
       solv.conf to force local processes to send queries to dnsmasq. Then either specify the upstream servers directly to  dnsmasq
       using  --server  options or put their addresses real in another file, say /etc/resolv.dnsmasq and run dnsmasq with the --re‐
       solv-file /etc/resolv.dnsmasq option. This second technique allows for dynamic update of the  server  addresses  by  PPP  or
       DHCP.

       Addresses in /etc/hosts will "shadow" different addresses for the same names in the upstream DNS, so "mycompany.com 1.2.3.4"
       in /etc/hosts will ensure that queries for "mycompany.com" always return 1.2.3.4 even if queries in the upstream  DNS  would
       otherwise return a different address. There is one exception to this: if the upstream DNS contains a CNAME which points to a
       shadowed name, then looking up the CNAME through dnsmasq will result in the unshadowed address associated with the target of
       the CNAME. To work around this, add the CNAME to /etc/hosts so that the CNAME is shadowed too.

       The tag system works as follows: For each DHCP request, dnsmasq collects a set of valid tags from active configuration lines
       which include set:&lt;tag&gt;, including one from the --dhcp-range used to allocate the address, one from any matching --dhcp-host
       (and  "known"  or "known-othernet" if a --dhcp-host matches) The tag "bootp" is set for BOOTP requests, and a tag whose name
       is the name of the interface on which the request arrived is also set.

       Any configuration lines which include one or more tag:&lt;tag&gt; constructs will only be valid if all that tags  are  matched  in
       the  set derived above. Typically this is --dhcp-option.  --dhcp-option which has tags will be used in preference  to an un‐
       tagged --dhcp-option, provided that _all_ the tags match somewhere in the set collected as described above. The  prefix  '!'
       on  a tag means 'not' so --dhcp-option=tag:!purple,3,1.2.3.4 sends the option when the tag purple is not in the set of valid
       tags. (If using this in a command line rather than a configuration file, be sure to escape !, which is a  shell  metacharac‐
       ter)

       When  selecting  --dhcp-options, a tag from --dhcp-range is second class relative to other tags, to make it easy to override
       options for individual hosts, so --dhcp-range=set:interface1,......  --dhcp-host=set:myhost,.....   --dhcp-option=tag:inter‐
       face1,option:nis-domain,"domain1"  --dhcp-option=tag:myhost,option:nis-domain,"domain2"  will  set the NIS-domain to domain1
       for hosts in the range, but override that to domain2 for a particular host.

       Note that for --dhcp-range both tag:&lt;tag&gt; and set:&lt;tag&gt; are allowed, to both select the range in use based on  (eg)  --dhcp-
       host, and to affect the options sent, based on the range selected.

       This  system  evolved  from an earlier, more limited one and for backward compatibility "net:" may be used instead of "tag:"
       and "set:" may be omitted. (Except in --dhcp-host, where "net:" may be used instead of "set:".) For the same reason, '#' may
       be used instead of '!' to indicate NOT.

       The  DHCP  server  in dnsmasq will function as a BOOTP server also, provided that the MAC address and IP address for clients
       are given, either using --dhcp-host configurations or in /etc/ethers , and a --dhcp-range configuration option is present to
       activate  the  DHCP  server on a particular network. (Setting --bootp-dynamic removes the need for static address mappings.)
       The filename parameter in a BOOTP request is used as a tag, as is the tag "bootp", allowing some control  over  the  options
       returned to different classes of hosts.

AUTHORITATIVE CONFIGURATION
       Configuring  dnsmasq  to act as an authoritative DNS server is complicated by the fact that it involves configuration of ex‐
       ternal DNS servers to provide delegation. We will walk through three scenarios of increasing complexity.  Prerequisites  for
       all  of  these scenarios are a globally accessible IP address, an A or AAAA record pointing to that address, and an external
       DNS server capable of doing delegation of the zone in question. For the first part of this explanation, we will call  the  A
       (or  AAAA)  record  for  the globally accessible address server.example.com, and the zone for which dnsmasq is authoritative
       our.zone.com.

       The simplest configuration consists of two lines of dnsmasq configuration; something like

       --auth-server=server.example.com,eth0
       --auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24

       and two records in the external DNS

       server.example.com       A    192.0.43.10
       our.zone.com            NS    server.example.com

       eth0 is the external network interface on which dnsmasq is listening, and has (globally accessible) address 192.0.43.10.

       Note that the external IP address may well be dynamic (ie assigned from an ISP by DHCP or PPP) If so, the A record  must  be
       linked to this dynamic assignment by one of the usual dynamic-DNS systems.

       A  more complex, but practically useful configuration has the address record for the globally accessible IP address residing
       in the authoritative zone which dnsmasq is serving, typically at the root. Now we have

       --auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0
       --auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24

       our.zone.com             A    1.2.3.4
       our.zone.com            NS    our.zone.com

       The A record for our.zone.com has now become a glue record, it solves the chicken-and-egg problem of finding the IP  address
       of the nameserver for our.zone.com when the A record is within that zone. Note that this is the only role of this record: as
       dnsmasq is now authoritative from our.zone.com it too must provide this record. If the external address is static, this  can
       be done with an /etc/hosts entry or --host-record.

       --auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0
       --host-record=our.zone.com,1.2.3.4
       --auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24

       If  the  external address is dynamic, the address associated with our.zone.com must be derived from the address of the rele‐
       vant interface. This is done using --interface-name Something like:

       --auth-server=our.zone.com,eth0
       --interface-name=our.zone.com,eth0
       --auth-zone=our.zone.com,1.2.3.0/24,eth0

       (The "eth0" argument in --auth-zone adds the subnet containing eth0's dynamic address to the zone, so that the  --interface-
       name returns the address in outside queries.)

       Our  final configuration builds on that above, but also adds a secondary DNS server. This is another DNS server which learns
       the DNS data for the zone by doing zones transfer, and acts as a backup should the primary server become  inaccessible.  The
       configuration of the secondary is beyond the scope of this man-page, but the extra configuration of dnsmasq is simple:

       --auth-sec-servers=secondary.myisp.com

       and

       our.zone.com           NS    secondary.myisp.com

       Adding auth-sec-servers enables zone transfer in dnsmasq, to allow the secondary to collect the DNS data. If you wish to re‐
       strict this data to particular hosts then

       --auth-peer=&lt;IP address of secondary&gt;

       will do so.

       Dnsmasq acts as an authoritative server for  in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa domains associated with the subnets given in  --auth-
       zone  declarations, so reverse (address to name) lookups can be simply configured with a suitable NS record, for instance in
       this example, where we allow 1.2.3.0/24 addresses.

        3.2.1.in-addr.arpa  NS    our.zone.com

       Note that at present, reverse (in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa) zones are not available in zone transfers, so there  is  no  point
       arranging secondary servers for reverse lookups.

       When dnsmasq is configured to act as an authoritative server, the following data is used to populate the authoritative zone.

       --mx-host, --srv-host, --dns-rr, --txt-record, --naptr-record, --caa-record, as long as the record names are in the authori‐
       tative domain.

       --synth-domain as long as the domain is in the authoritative zone and, for reverse (PTR) queries, the address is in the rel‐
       evant subnet.

       --cname  as  long as the record name is in  the authoritative domain. If the target of the CNAME is unqualified, then it  is
       qualified with the authoritative zone name. CNAME used in this way (only) may be wildcards, as in

       --cname=*.example.com,default.example.com

       IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from /etc/hosts (and --addn-hosts ) and --host-record and --interface-name and ---dynamic-host  pro‐
       vided the address falls into one of the subnets specified in the --auth-zone.

       Addresses  of DHCP leases, provided the address falls into one of the subnets specified in the --auth-zone.  (If constructed
       DHCP ranges are is use, which depend on the address dynamically assigned to an interface, then the form of --auth-zone which
       defines subnets by the dynamic address of an interface should be used to ensure this condition is met.)

       In  the  default  mode, where a DHCP lease has an unqualified name, and possibly a qualified name constructed using --domain
       then the name in the authoritative zone is constructed from the unqualified name and the zone's domain. This may or may  not
       equal  that  specified  by  --domain.  If --dhcp-fqdn is set, then the fully qualified names associated with DHCP leases are
       used, and must match the zone's domain.

EXIT CODES
       0 - Dnsmasq successfully forked into the background, or terminated normally if backgrounding is not enabled.

       1 - A problem with configuration was detected.

       2 - A problem with network access occurred (address in use, attempt to use privileged ports without permission).

       3 - A problem occurred with a filesystem operation (missing file/directory, permissions).

       4 - Memory allocation failure.

       5 - Other miscellaneous problem.

       11 or greater - a non zero return code was received from the lease-script process "init" call or a --conf-script  file.  The
       exit code from dnsmasq is the script's exit code with 10 added.

LIMITS
       The  default  values for resource limits in dnsmasq are generally conservative, and appropriate for embedded router type de‐
       vices with slow processors and limited memory. On more capable hardware, it is possible to increase the limits,  and  handle
       many more clients. The following applies to dnsmasq-2.37: earlier versions did not scale as well.

       Dnsmasq  is  capable of handling DNS and DHCP for at least a thousand clients. The DHCP lease times should not be very short
       (less than one hour). The value of --dns-forward-max can be increased: start with it equal to the number of clients and  in‐
       crease  if DNS seems slow. Note that DNS performance depends too on the performance of the upstream nameservers. The size of
       the DNS cache may be increased: the hard limit is 10000 names and the default (150) is very low. Sending SIGUSR1 to  dnsmasq
       makes it log information which is useful for tuning the cache size. See the NOTES section for details.

       The  built-in  TFTP  server  is  capable of many simultaneous file transfers: the absolute limit is related to the number of
       file-handles allowed to a process and the ability of the select() system call to cope with large numbers of file handles. If
       the  limit  is  set too high using --tftp-max it will be scaled down and the actual limit logged at start-up. Note that more
       transfers are possible when the same file is being sent than when each transfer sends a different file.

       It is possible to use dnsmasq to block Web advertising by using  a  list  of  known  banner-ad  servers,  all  resolving  to
       127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0, in /etc/hosts or an additional hosts file. The list can be very long, dnsmasq has been tested success‐
       fully with one million names. That size file needs a 1GHz processor and about 60Mb of RAM.

INTERNATIONALISATION
       Dnsmasq can be compiled to support internationalisation. To do this, the make targets "all-i18n" and  "install-i18n"  should
       be  used instead of the standard targets "all" and "install". When internationalisation is compiled in, dnsmasq will produce
       log messages in the local language and support internationalised domain names (IDN). Domain names in /etc/hosts, /etc/ethers
       and  /etc/dnsmasq.conf  which  contain  non-ASCII characters will be translated to the DNS-internal punycode representation.
       Note that dnsmasq determines both the language for messages and the assumed charset for configuration files  from  the  LANG
       environment  variable.  This  should be set to the system default value by the script which is responsible for starting dns‐
       masq. When editing the configuration files, be careful to do so using only the system-default locale and  not  user-specific
       one, since dnsmasq has no direct way of determining the charset in use, and must assume that it is the system default.
