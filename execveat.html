<pre>execveat(2)                                             System Calls Manual                                             execveat(2)

NAME
       execveat - execute program relative to a directory file descriptor

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/fcntl.h&gt;      /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int execveat(int dirfd, const char *pathname,
                    char *const _Nullable argv[],
                    char *const _Nullable envp[],
                    int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The  execveat()  system  call executes the program referred to by the combination of dirfd and pathname.  It operates in ex‐
       actly the same way as execve(2), except for the differences described in this manual page.

       If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file  de‐
       scriptor  dirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling process, as is done by execve(2) for a
       relative pathname).

       If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the current  work‐
       ing directory of the calling process (like execve(2)).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

       If pathname is an empty string and the AT_EMPTY_PATH flag is specified, then the file descriptor dirfd specifies the file to
       be executed (i.e., dirfd refers to an executable file, rather than a directory).

       The flags argument is a bit mask that can include zero or more of the following flags:

       AT_EMPTY_PATH
              If pathname is an empty string, operate on the file referred to by dirfd (which may  have  been  obtained  using  the
              open(2) O_PATH flag).

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
              If the file identified by dirfd and a non-NULL pathname is a symbolic link, then the call fails with the error ELOOP.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, execveat() does not return.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The  same  errors that occur for execve(2) can also occur for execveat().  The following additional errors can occur for ex‐
       ecveat():

       pathname
              is relative but dirfd is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL Invalid flag specified in flags.

       ELOOP  flags includes AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW and the file identified by dirfd and a non-NULL pathname is a symbolic link.

       ENOENT The program identified by dirfd and pathname requires the use of an interpreter program (such as  a  script  starting
              with  "#!"),  but the file descriptor dirfd was opened with the O_CLOEXEC flag, with the result that the program file
              is inaccessible to the launched interpreter.  See BUGS.

       ENOTDIR
              pathname is relative and dirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.

VERSIONS
       execveat() was added in Linux 3.19.  Library support was added in glibc 2.34.

STANDARDS
       The execveat() system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       In addition to the reasons explained in openat(2), the execveat() system call is also needed to allow fexecve(3) to  be  im‐
       plemented on systems that do not have the /proc filesystem mounted.

       When  asked to execute a script file, the argv[0] that is passed to the script interpreter is a string of the form /dev/fd/N
       or /dev/fd/N/P, where N is the number of the file descriptor passed via the dirfd argument.  A string of the first form  oc‐
       curs  when  AT_EMPTY_PATH  is  employed.  A string of the second form occurs when the script is specified via both dirfd and
       pathname; in this case, P is the value given in pathname.

       For the same reasons described in fexecve(3), the natural idiom when using execveat() is to set the  close-on-exec  flag  on
       dirfd.  (But see BUGS.)

BUGS
       The ENOENT error described above means that it is not possible to set the close-on-exec flag on the file descriptor given to
       a call of the form:

           execveat(fd, "", argv, envp, AT_EMPTY_PATH);

       However, the inability to set the close-on-exec flag means that a file descriptor referring to the script leaks  through  to
       the  script  itself.  As well as wasting a file descriptor, this leakage can lead to file-descriptor exhaustion in scenarios
       where scripts recursively employ execveat().
