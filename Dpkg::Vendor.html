NAME
       Dpkg::Vendor - get access to some vendor specific information

DESCRIPTION
       The files in $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/ can provide information about various vendors who are providing Debian packages.
       Currently those files look like this:

         Vendor: Debian
         Vendor-URL: https://www.debian.org/
         Bugs: debbugs://bugs.debian.org

       If the vendor derives from another vendor, the file should document the relationship by listing the base distribution in the
       Parent field:

         Parent: Debian

       The file should be named according to the vendor name. The usual convention is to name the vendor file using the vendor name
       in all lowercase, but some variation is permitted. Namely, spaces are mapped to dashes ('-'), and the file can have the same
       casing as the Vendor field, or it can be capitalized.

FUNCTIONS
       $dir = get_vendor_dir()
           Returns the current dpkg origins directory name, where the vendor files are stored.

       $fields = get_vendor_info($name)
           Returns a Dpkg::Control object with the information parsed from the corresponding vendor file in
           $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/. If $name is omitted, it will use $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/default which is supposed to be a
           symlink to the vendor of the currently installed operating system. Returns undef if there's no file for the given
           vendor.

       $name = get_vendor_file($name)
           Check if there's a file for the given vendor and returns its name.

           The vendor filename will be derived from the vendor name, by replacing any number of non-alphanumeric characters (that
           is [^A-Za-z0-9]) into "-", then the resulting name will be tried in sequence by lower-casing it, keeping it as is,
           lower-casing then capitalizing it, and capitalizing it.

           In addition, for historical and backwards compatibility, the name will be tried keeping it as is without non-
           alphanumeric characters remapping, then the resulting name will be tried in sequence by lower-casing it, keeping it as
           is, lower-casing then capitalizing it, and capitalizing it.  And finally the name will be tried by replacing only spaces
           to "-", then the resulting name will be tried in sequence by lower-casing it, keeping it as is, lower-casing then
           capitalizing it, and capitalizing it.

           But these backwards compatible name lookups will be removed during the dpkg 1.22.x release cycle.

       $name = get_current_vendor()
           Returns the name of the current vendor. If DEB_VENDOR is set, it uses that first, otherwise it falls back to parsing
           $Dpkg::CONFDIR/origins/default.  If that file doesn't exist, it returns undef.

       $object = get_vendor_object($name)
           Return the Dpkg::Vendor::* object of the corresponding vendor.  If $name is omitted, return the object of the current
           vendor.  If no vendor can be identified, then return the Dpkg::Vendor::Default object.

           The module name will be derived from the vendor name, by splitting parts around groups of non alphanumeric character
           (that is [^A-Za-z0-9]) separators, by either capitalizing or lower-casing and capitalizing each part and then joining
           them without the separators. So the expected casing is based on the one from the Vendor field in the origins file.

           In addition, for historical and backwards compatibility, the module name will also be looked up without non-alphanumeric
           character stripping, by capitalizing, lower-casing then capitalizing, as-is or lower-casing.  But these name lookups
           will be removed during the 1.22.x release cycle.

       run_vendor_hook($hookid, @params)
           Run a hook implemented by the current vendor object.

CHANGES
   Version 1.02 (dpkg 1.21.10)
       Deprecated behavior: get_vendor_file() loading vendor files with no special characters remapping. get_vendor_object()
       loading vendor module names with no special character stripping.

   Version 1.01 (dpkg 1.17.0)
       New function: get_vendor_dir().

   Version 1.00 (dpkg 1.16.1)
       Mark the module as public.
