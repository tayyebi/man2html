dotnet migrate
       This article applies to: ✔️ .NET Core 2.x SDK

NAME
       dotnet-migrate - Migrates a Preview 2 .NET Core project to a .NET Core SDK-style project.

SYNOPSIS
              dotnet migrate [&lt;SOLUTION_FILE|PROJECT_DIR&gt;] [--format-report-file-json &lt;REPORT_FILE&gt;]
                  [-r|--report-file &lt;REPORT_FILE&gt;] [-s|--skip-project-references [Debug|Release]]
                  [--skip-backup] [-t|--template-file &lt;TEMPLATE_FILE&gt;] [-v|--sdk-package-version]
                  [-x|--xproj-file]

              dotnet migrate -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       This command is deprecated.  The dotnet migrate command is no longer available starting with .NET Core 3.0 SDK.  It can only
       migrate a Preview 2 .NET Core project to a 1.x .NET Core project, which is out of support.

       By default, the command migrates the root project and any project references that the root project contains.  This  behavior
       is disabled using the --skip-project-references option at run time.

       Migration can be performed on the following assets:

       • A single project by specifying the project.json file to migrate.

       • All of the directories specified in the global.json file by passing in a path to the global.json file.

       • A solution.sln file, where it migrates the projects referenced in the solution.

       • On all subdirectories of the given directory recursively.

       The dotnet migrate command keeps the migrated project.json file inside a backup directory, which it creates if the directory
       doesn’t exist.  This behavior is overridden using the --skip-backup option.

       By default, the migration operation outputs the state of the migration process to standard output (STDOUT).  If you use  the
       --report-file &lt;REPORT_FILE&gt; option, the output is saved to the file specify.

       The  dotnet migrate command only supports valid Preview 2 project.json-based projects.  This means that you cannot use it to
       migrate DNX or Preview 1 project.json-based projects directly to MSBuild/csproj projects.  You first need  to  manually  mi‐
       grate the project to a Preview 2 project.json-based project and then use the dotnet migrate command to migrate the project.

ARGUMENTS
       PROJECT_JSON/GLOBAL_JSON/SOLUTION_FILE/PROJECT_DIR

       The path to one of the following:

       • a project.json file to migrate.

       • a global.json file: the folders specified in global.json are migrated.

       • a solution.sln file: the projects referenced in the solution are migrated.

       • a directory to migrate: recursively searches for project.json files to migrate inside the specified directory.

       Defaults to current directory if nothing is specified.

OPTIONS
       --format-report-file-json &lt;REPORT_FILE&gt;

       Output migration report file as JSON rather than user messages.

       -h|--help

       Prints out a short help for the command.

       -r|--report-file &lt;REPORT_FILE&gt;

       Output migration report to a file in addition to the console.

       -s|--skip-project-references [Debug|Release]

       Skip migrating project references.  By default, project references are migrated recursively.

       --skip-backup

       Skip moving project.json, global.json, and *.xproj to a backup directory after successful migration.

       -t|--template-file &lt;TEMPLATE_FILE&gt;

       Template csproj file to use for migration.  By default, the same template as the one dropped by dotnet new console is used.

       -v|--sdk-package-version &lt;VERSION&gt;

       The version of the sdk package that’s referenced in the migrated app.  The default is the version of the SDK in dotnet new.

       -x|--xproj-file &lt;FILE&gt;

       The path to the xproj file to use.  Required when there is more than one xproj in a project directory.

EXAMPLES
       Migrate a project in the current directory and all of its project-to-project dependencies:

       dotnet migrate

       Migrate all projects that global.json file includes:

       dotnet migrate path/to/global.json

       Migrate only the current project and no project-to-project (P2P) dependencies.  Also, use a specific SDK version:

       dotnet migrate -s -v 1.0.0-preview4
