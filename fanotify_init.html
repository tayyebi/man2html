fanotify_init(2)                                        System Calls Manual                                        fanotify_init(2)

NAME
       fanotify_init - create and initialize fanotify group

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;            /* Definition of O_* constants */
       #include &lt;sys/fanotify.h&gt;

       int fanotify_init(unsigned int flags, unsigned int event_f_flags);

DESCRIPTION
       For an overview of the fanotify API, see fanotify(7).

       fanotify_init()  initializes  a  new  fanotify  group  and returns a file descriptor for the event queue associated with the
       group.

       The file descriptor is used in calls to fanotify_mark(2) to specify the files, directories, mounts, or filesystems for which
       fanotify  events shall be created.  These events are received by reading from the file descriptor.  Some events are only in‐
       formative, indicating that a file has been accessed.  Other events can be used to determine whether another  application  is
       permitted to access a file or directory.  Permission to access filesystem objects is granted by writing to the file descrip‐
       tor.

       Multiple programs may be using the fanotify interface at the same time to monitor the same files.

       The number of fanotify groups per user is limited.  See fanotify(7) for details about this limit.

       The flags argument contains a multi-bit field defining the notification class of the listening application and further  sin‐
       gle bit fields specifying the behavior of the file descriptor.

       If  multiple  listeners  for  permission events exist, the notification class is used to establish the sequence in which the
       listeners receive the events.

       Only one of the following notification classes may be specified in flags:

       FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT
              This value allows the receipt of events notifying that a file has been accessed and events for  permission  decisions
              if  a  file  may be accessed.  It is intended for event listeners that need to access files before they contain their
              final data.  This notification class might be used by hierarchical storage managers, for example.  Use of  this  flag
              requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_CLASS_CONTENT
              This  value  allows the receipt of events notifying that a file has been accessed and events for permission decisions
              if a file may be accessed.  It is intended for event listeners that need to access files when  they  already  contain
              their  final content.  This notification class might be used by malware detection programs, for example.  Use of this
              flag requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_CLASS_NOTIF
              This is the default value.  It does not need to be specified.  This value only allows the receipt of events notifying
              that a file has been accessed.  Permission decisions before the file is accessed are not possible.

       Listeners  with  different  notification  classes will receive events in the order FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT, FAN_CLASS_CONTENT,
       FAN_CLASS_NOTIF.  The order of notification for listeners in the same notification class is undefined.

       The following bits can additionally be set in flags:

       FAN_CLOEXEC
              Set the close-on-exec flag (FD_CLOEXEC) on the new file descriptor.  See the description of  the  O_CLOEXEC  flag  in
              open(2).

       FAN_NONBLOCK
              Enable  the  nonblocking flag (O_NONBLOCK) for the file descriptor.  Reading from the file descriptor will not block.
              Instead, if no data is available, read(2) fails with the error EAGAIN.

       FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE
              Remove the limit on the number of events in the event queue.  See fanotify(7) for details about this limit.   Use  of
              this flag requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS
              Remove  the  limit  on  the number of fanotify marks per user.  See fanotify(7) for details about this limit.  Use of
              this flag requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_REPORT_TID (since Linux 4.20)
              Report thread ID (TID) instead of process ID (PID) in the pid field of the struct fanotify_event_metadata supplied to
              read(2) (see fanotify(7)).  Use of this flag requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT (since Linux 4.15)
              Enable  generation  of audit log records about access mediation performed by permission events.  The permission event
              response has to be marked with the FAN_AUDIT flag for an audit log record to be generated.  Use of this flag requires
              the CAP_AUDIT_WRITE capability.

       FAN_REPORT_FID (since Linux 5.1)
              This  value  allows the receipt of events which contain additional information about the underlying filesystem object
              correlated to an event.  An additional record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID encapsulates the information about  the
              object and is included alongside the generic event metadata structure.  The file descriptor that is used to represent
              the object correlated to an event is instead substituted with a file handle.  It is intended  for  applications  that
              may  find  the use of a file handle to identify an object more suitable than a file descriptor.  Additionally, it may
              be used for applications monitoring a directory or a filesystem that are interested in the directory entry  modifica‐
              tion  events  FAN_CREATE, FAN_DELETE, FAN_MOVE, and FAN_RENAME, or in events such as FAN_ATTRIB, FAN_DELETE_SELF, and
              FAN_MOVE_SELF.  All the events above require an fanotify group that identifies filesystem objects  by  file  handles.
              Note  that  without the flag FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID, for the directory entry modification events, there is an informa‐
              tion record that identifies the modified directory and not  the  created/deleted/moved  child  object.   The  use  of
              FAN_CLASS_CONTENT  or FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT is not permitted with this flag and will result in the error EINVAL.  See
              fanotify(7) for additional details.

       FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID (since Linux 5.9)
              Events for fanotify groups initialized with this flag will contain  (see  exceptions  below)  additional  information
              about  a directory object correlated to an event.  An additional record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID encapsulates
              the information about the directory object and is included alongside  the  generic  event  metadata  structure.   For
              events that occur on a non-directory object, the additional structure includes a file handle that identifies the par‐
              ent directory filesystem object.  Note that there is no guarantee that the directory filesystem object will be  found
              at  the  location described by the file handle information at the time the event is received.  When combined with the
              flag FAN_REPORT_FID, two records may be reported with events that occur on a non-directory object,  one  to  identify
              the non-directory object itself and one to identify the parent directory object.  Note that in some cases, a filesys‐
              tem object does not have a parent, for example, when an event occurs on an unlinked but open  file.   In  that  case,
              with  the  FAN_REPORT_FID  flag, the event will be reported with only one record to identify the non-directory object
              itself, because there is no directory associated with the event.  Without the FAN_REPORT_FID flag, no event  will  be
              reported.  See fanotify(7) for additional details.

       FAN_REPORT_NAME (since Linux 5.9)
              Events  for  fanotify groups initialized with this flag will contain additional information about the name of the di‐
              rectory entry correlated to an event.  This flag must be provided in conjunction with  the  flag  FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID.
              Providing this flag value without FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID will result in the error EINVAL.  This flag may be combined with
              the flag FAN_REPORT_FID.  An additional record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME, which encapsulates the informa‐
              tion  about the directory entry, is included alongside the generic event metadata structure and substitutes the addi‐
              tional information record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID.  The additional record includes a file handle that  iden‐
              tifies  a  directory filesystem object followed by a name that identifies an entry in that directory.  For the direc‐
              tory entry modification events FAN_CREATE,  FAN_DELETE,  and  FAN_MOVE,  the  reported  name  is  that  of  the  cre‐
              ated/deleted/moved  directory  entry.   The  event  FAN_RENAME  may  contain  two  information  records.  One of type
              FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_OLD_DFID_NAME    identifying    the    old    directory    entry,    and    another    of    type
              FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_NEW_DFID_NAME  identifying  the  new directory entry.  For other events that occur on a directory
              object, the reported file handle is that of the directory object itself and the reported  name  is  '.'.   For  other
              events  that occur on a non-directory object, the reported file handle is that of the parent directory object and the
              reported name is the name of a directory entry where the object was located at the time of the event.  The  rationale
              behind this logic is that the reported directory file handle can be passed to open_by_handle_at(2) to get an open di‐
              rectory file descriptor and that file descriptor along with the reported name can be used to  call  fstatat(2).   The
              same    rule    that    applies   to   record   type   FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID   also   applies   to   record   type
              FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME: if a non-directory object has no parent, either the event will not be reported  or  it
              will be reported without the directory entry information.  Note that there is no guarantee that the filesystem object
              will be found at the location described by the directory entry information at the time the event  is  received.   See
              fanotify(7) for additional details.

       FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME
              This is a synonym for (FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID|FAN_REPORT_NAME).

       FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID (since Linux 5.17)
              Events  for fanotify groups initialized with this flag will contain additional information about the child correlated
              with directory entry modification events.  This flag must be provided in conjunction with the  flags  FAN_REPORT_FID,
              FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID  and FAN_REPORT_NAME.  or else the error EINVAL will be returned.  For the directory entry modifi‐
              cation events FAN_CREATE, FAN_DELETE, FAN_MOVE, and FAN_RENAME, an additional record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID,
              is  reported  in addition to the information records of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID, FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME,
              FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_OLD_DFID_NAME, and FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_NEW_DFID_NAME.  The additional record includes a file han‐
              dle that identifies the filesystem child object that the directory entry is referring to.

       FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME_TARGET
              This is a synonym for (FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME|FAN_REPORT_FID|FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID).

       FAN_REPORT_PIDFD (since Linux 5.15)
              Events  for  fanotify  groups  initialized with this flag will contain an additional information record alongside the
              generic fanotify_event_metadata structure.  This information record will be  of  type  FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_PIDFD  and
              will contain a pidfd for the process that was responsible for generating an event.  A pidfd returned in this informa‐
              tion record object is no different to the pidfd that is returned when calling pidfd_open(2).  Usage of this  informa‐
              tion  record  are for applications that may be interested in reliably determining whether the process responsible for
              generating an event has been recycled or terminated.  The use of the FAN_REPORT_TID flag along with  FAN_REPORT_PIDFD
              is  currently  not supported and attempting to do so will result in the error EINVAL being returned.  This limitation
              is currently imposed by the pidfd API as it currently only supports the creation of pidfds for thread-group  leaders.
              Creating  pidfds  for  non-thread-group leaders may be supported at some point in the future, so this restriction may
              eventually be lifted.  For more details on information records, see fanotify(7).

       The event_f_flags argument defines the file status flags that will be set on the open file descriptions that are created for
       fanotify  events.  For details of these flags, see the description of the flags values in open(2).  event_f_flags includes a
       multi-bit field for the access mode.  This field can take the following values:

       O_RDONLY
              This value allows only read access.

       O_WRONLY
              This value allows only write access.

       O_RDWR This value allows read and write access.

       Additional bits can be set in event_f_flags.  The most useful values are:

       O_LARGEFILE
              Enable support for files exceeding 2 GB.  Failing to set this flag will result in an EOVERFLOW error when  trying  to
              open a large file which is monitored by an fanotify group on a 32-bit system.

       O_CLOEXEC (since Linux 3.18)
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the file descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for rea‐
              sons why this may be useful.

       The following are also allowable: O_APPEND, O_DSYNC, O_NOATIME, O_NONBLOCK,  and  O_SYNC.   Specifying  any  other  flag  in
       event_f_flags yields the error EINVAL (but see BUGS).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  fanotify_init() returns a new file descriptor.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the er‐
       ror.

ERRORS
       EINVAL An invalid value was passed in flags or event_f_flags.  FAN_ALL_INIT_FLAGS (deprecated since Linux 4.20) defines  all
              allowable bits for flags.

       EMFILE The number of fanotify groups for this user exceeds the limit.  See fanotify(7) for details about this limit.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENOMEM The allocation of memory for the notification group failed.

       ENOSYS This kernel does not implement fanotify_init().  The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was configured with
              CONFIG_FANOTIFY.

       EPERM  The operation is not permitted because the caller lacks a required capability.

VERSIONS
       fanotify_init() was introduced in Linux 2.6.36 and enabled in Linux 2.6.37.

       Prior to Linux 5.13, calling fanotify_init() required the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  Since Linux 5.13, users may  call  fan‐
       otify_init() without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to create and initialize an fanotify group with limited functionality.

       The limitations imposed on an event listener created by a user without the
              CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability are as follows:

              •  The user cannot request for an unlimited event queue by using FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE.

              •  The user cannot request for an unlimited number of marks by using FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS.

              •  The user cannot request to use either notification classes FAN_CLASS_CONTENT or FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT.  This means
                 that user cannot request permission events.

              •  The user is required to create a group that identifies filesystem objects by file handles, for example, by provid‐
                 ing the FAN_REPORT_FID flag.

              •  The  user  is  limited to only mark inodes.  The ability to mark a mount or filesystem via fanotify_mark() through
                 the use of FAN_MARK_MOUNT or FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM is not permitted.

              •  The event object in the event queue is limited in terms of the information that is made available to the  unprivi‐
                 leged  user.   A  user will also not receive the pid that generated the event, unless the listening process itself
                 generated the event.

STANDARDS
       This system call is Linux-specific.

BUGS
       The following bug was present before Linux 3.18:

       •  The O_CLOEXEC is ignored when passed in event_f_flags.

       The following bug was present before Linux 3.14:

       •  The event_f_flags argument is not checked for invalid flags.  Flags that are intended only  for  internal  use,  such  as
          FMODE_EXEC,  can  be  set,  and will consequently be set for the file descriptors returned when reading from the fanotify
          file descriptor.
