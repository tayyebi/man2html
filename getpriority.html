<pre>getpriority(2)                                          System Calls Manual                                          getpriority(2)

NAME
       getpriority, setpriority - get/set program scheduling priority

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;

       int getpriority(int which, id_t who);
       int setpriority(int which, id_t who, int prio);

DESCRIPTION
       The scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user, as indicated by which and who is obtained with the getprior‐
       ity() call and set with the setpriority() call.  The process attribute dealt with by these system calls is the  same  attri‐
       bute (also known as the "nice" value) that is dealt with by nice(2).

       The value which is one of PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER, and who is interpreted relative to which (a process identi‐
       fier for PRIO_PROCESS, process group identifier for PRIO_PGRP, and a user ID for PRIO_USER).  A zero value for  who  denotes
       (respectively) the calling process, the process group of the calling process, or the real user ID of the calling process.

       The  prio argument is a value in the range -20 to 19 (but see NOTES below), with -20 being the highest priority and 19 being
       the lowest priority.  Attempts to set a priority outside this range are silently clamped to the range.  The default priority
       is 0; lower values give a process a higher scheduling priority.

       The getpriority() call returns the highest priority (lowest numerical value) enjoyed by any of the specified processes.  The
       setpriority() call sets the priorities of all of the specified processes to the specified value.

       Traditionally, only a privileged process could lower the nice value (i.e., set a higher  priority).   However,  since  Linux
       2.6.12,  an unprivileged process can decrease the nice value of a target process that has a suitable RLIMIT_NICE soft limit;
       see getrlimit(2) for details.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, getpriority() returns the calling thread's nice value, which may be a negative number.  On error, it returns  -1
       and sets errno to indicate the error.

       Since  a  successful call to getpriority() can legitimately return the value -1, it is necessary to clear errno prior to the
       call, then check errno afterward to determine if -1 is an error or a legitimate value.

       setpriority() returns 0 on success.  On failure, it returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The caller attempted to set a lower nice value (i.e., a higher process priority), but did not have the required priv‐
              ilege (on Linux: did not have the CAP_SYS_NICE capability).

       EINVAL which was not one of PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER.

       EPERM  A  process  was  located,  but  its  effective  user ID did not match either the effective or the real user ID of the
              caller, and was not privileged (on Linux: did not have the CAP_SYS_NICE capability).  But see NOTES below.

       ESRCH  No process was located using the which and who values specified.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD (these interfaces first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       For further details on the nice value, see sched(7).

       Note: the addition of the "autogroup" feature in Linux 2.6.38 means that the nice value no longer has its traditional effect
       in many circumstances.  For details, see sched(7).

       A child created by fork(2) inherits its parent's nice value.  The nice value is preserved across execve(2).

       The  details on the condition for EPERM depend on the system.  The above description is what POSIX.1-2001 says, and seems to
       be followed on all System V-like systems.  Linux kernels before Linux 2.6.12 required the real or effective user ID  of  the
       caller to match the real user of the process who (instead of its effective user ID).  Linux 2.6.12 and later require the ef‐
       fective user ID of the caller to match the real or effective user ID of the process who.  All BSD-like systems (SunOS 4.1.3,
       Ultrix 4.2, 4.3BSD, FreeBSD 4.3, OpenBSD-2.5, ...) behave in the same manner as Linux 2.6.12 and later.

   C library/kernel differences
       The getpriority system call returns nice values translated to the range 40..1, since a negative return value would be inter‐
       preted as an error.  The glibc wrapper function for getpriority()  translates  the  value  back  according  to  the  formula
       unice = 20 - knice (thus, the 40..1 range returned by the kernel corresponds to the range -20..19 as seen by user space).

BUGS
       According  to POSIX, the nice value is a per-process setting.  However, under the current Linux/NPTL implementation of POSIX
       threads, the nice value is a per-thread attribute: different threads in the same process can  have  different  nice  values.
       Portable applications should avoid relying on the Linux behavior, which may be made standards conformant in the future.
