NAME
       Encode::Locale - Determine the locale encoding

SYNOPSIS
         use Encode::Locale;
         use Encode;

         $string = decode(locale =&gt; $bytes);
         $bytes = encode(locale =&gt; $string);

         if (-t) {
             binmode(STDIN, ":encoding(console_in)");
             binmode(STDOUT, ":encoding(console_out)");
             binmode(STDERR, ":encoding(console_out)");
         }

         # Processing file names passed in as arguments
         my $uni_filename = decode(locale =&gt; $ARGV[0]);
         open(my $fh, "&lt;", encode(locale_fs =&gt; $uni_filename))
            || die "Can't open '$uni_filename': $!";
         binmode($fh, ":encoding(locale)");
         ...

DESCRIPTION
       In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it processes.  Most of the interfaces Perl has to the
       outside world are still byte based.  Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program from the outside
       and encode them again on the way out.

       The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions requested by the user and the preferred character
       set to consume and output.  The "Encode::Locale" module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET in the locale
       jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding under the name "locale".  It means bytes obtained from the
       environment can be converted to Unicode strings by calling "Encode::encode(locale =&gt; $bytes)" and converted back again with
       "Encode::decode(locale =&gt; $string)".

       Where file systems interfaces pass file names in and out of the program we also need care.  The trend is for operating
       systems to use a fixed file encoding that don't actually depend on the locale; and this module determines the most
       appropriate encoding for file names. The Encode module will know this encoding under the name "locale_fs".  For traditional
       Unix systems this will be an alias to the same encoding as "locale".

       For programs running in a terminal window (called a "Console" on some systems) the "locale" encoding is usually a good
       choice for what to expect as input and output.  Some systems allows us to query the encoding set for the terminal and
       "Encode::Locale" will do that if available and make these encodings known under the "Encode" aliases "console_in" and
       "console_out".  For systems where we can't determine the terminal encoding these will be aliased as the same encoding as
       "locale".  The advice is to use "console_in" for input known to come from the terminal and "console_out" for output to the
       terminal.

       In addition to arranging for various Encode aliases the following functions and variables are provided:

       decode_argv( )
       decode_argv( Encode::FB_CROAK )
           This will decode the command line arguments to perl (the @ARGV array) in-place.

           The function will by default replace characters that can't be decoded by "\x{FFFD}", the Unicode replacement character.

           Any argument provided is passed as CHECK to underlying Encode::decode() call.  Pass the value "Encode::FB_CROAK" to have
           the decoding croak if not all the command line arguments can be decoded.  See "Handling Malformed Data" in Encode for
           details on other options for CHECK.

       env( $uni_key )
       env( $uni_key =&gt; $uni_value )
           Interface to get/set environment variables.  Returns the current value as a Unicode string. The $uni_key and $uni_value
           arguments are expected to be Unicode strings as well.  Passing "undef" as $uni_value deletes the environment variable
           named $uni_key.

           The returned value will have the characters that can't be decoded replaced by "\x{FFFD}", the Unicode replacement
           character.

           There is no interface to request alternative CHECK behavior as for decode_argv().  If you need that you need to call
           encode/decode yourself.  For example:

               my $key = Encode::encode(locale =&gt; $uni_key, Encode::FB_CROAK);
               my $uni_value = Encode::decode(locale =&gt; $ENV{$key}, Encode::FB_CROAK);

       reinit( )
       reinit( $encoding )
           Reinitialize the encodings from the locale.  You want to call this function if you changed anything in the environment
           that might influence the locale.

           This function will croak if the determined encoding isn't recognized by the Encode module.

           With argument force $ENCODING_... variables to set to the given value.

       $ENCODING_LOCALE
           The encoding name determined to be suitable for the current locale.  Encode know this encoding as "locale".

       $ENCODING_LOCALE_FS
           The encoding name determined to be suitable for file system interfaces involving file names.  Encode know this encoding
           as "locale_fs".

       $ENCODING_CONSOLE_IN
       $ENCODING_CONSOLE_OUT
           The encodings to be used for reading and writing output to the a console.  Encode know these encodings as "console_in"
           and "console_out".

NOTES
       This table summarizes the mapping of the encodings set up by the "Encode::Locale" module:

         Encode      |         |              |
         Alias       | Windows | Mac OS X     | POSIX
         ------------+---------+--------------+------------
         locale      | ANSI    | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo
         locale_fs   | ANSI    | UTF-8        | nl_langinfo
         console_in  | OEM     | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo
         console_out | OEM     | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo

   Windows
       Windows has basically 2 sets of APIs.  A wide API (based on passing UTF-16 strings) and a byte based API based a character
       set called ANSI.  The regular Perl interfaces to the OS currently only uses the ANSI APIs.  Unfortunately ANSI is not a
       single character set.

       The encoding that corresponds to ANSI varies between different editions of Windows.  For many western editions of Windows
       ANSI corresponds to CP-1252 which is a character set similar to ISO-8859-1.  Conceptually the ANSI character set is a
       similar concept to the POSIX locale CODESET so this module figures out what the ANSI code page is and make this available as
       $ENCODING_LOCALE and the "locale" Encoding alias.

       Windows systems also operate with another byte based character set.  It's called the OEM code page.  This is the encoding
       that the Console takes as input and output.  It's common for the OEM code page to differ from the ANSI code page.

   Mac OS X
       On Mac OS X the file system encoding is always UTF-8 while the locale can otherwise be set up as normal for POSIX systems.

       File names on Mac OS X will at the OS-level be converted to NFD-form.  A file created by passing a NFC-filename will come in
       NFD-form from readdir().  See Unicode::Normalize for details of NFD/NFC.

       Actually, Apple does not follow the Unicode NFD standard since not all character ranges are decomposed.  The claim is that
       this avoids problems with round trip conversions from old Mac text encodings.  See Encode::UTF8Mac for details.

   POSIX (Linux and other Unixes)
       File systems might vary in what encoding is to be used for filenames.  Since this module has no way to actually figure out
       what the is correct it goes with the best guess which is to assume filenames are encoding according to the current locale.
       Users are advised to always specify UTF-8 as the locale charset.
