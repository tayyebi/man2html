<pre>GPROFNG(1)                                                 User Commands                                                 GPROFNG(1)

NAME
       gprofng - GNU gprofng

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng [OPTION(S)] ACTION [QUALIFIER] [ARGUMENTS] TARGET

DESCRIPTION
       This is the driver for the GPROFNG tools suite to gather and analyze performance data.

       The driver executes the action specified. An example of an action is "collect" to collect performance data. Depending on the
       action, a qualifier may be needed to define the command. Several qualifiers support options. The last item on the command is
       the target the command applies to.

       For example, to collect performance data for an application called "a.out" and store the results in experiment directory
       "mydata.er", the following command may be used:

               $ gprofng collect app -o mydata.er a.out

       In this example, the action is "collect", the qualifier is "app", the single argument is "-o mydata.er" and the target is
       "a.out".

       If gprofng is executed without any additional option, action, or target, a usage overview is printed.

OPTIONS
       --version
           print the version number and exit.

       --help
           print usage information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are supported:

       "GPROFNG_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH"
           set the depth of the call stack (default is 256).

       "GPROFNG_USE_JAVA_OPTIONS"
           may be set when profiling a C/C++ application that uses dlopen() to execute Java code.

       "GPROFNG_SSH_REMOTE_DISPLAY"
           use this variable to define the ssh command executed by the remote display tool.

       "GPROFNG_SKIP_VALIDATION"
           set this variable to disable checking hardware, system, and Java versions.

       "GPROFNG_ALLOW_CORE_DUMP"
           set this variable to allow a core file to be generated; otherwise an error report is created on /tmp.

       "GPROFNG_ARCHIVE"
           use this variable to define the settings for automatic archiving upon experiment recording completion.

       "GPROFNG_ARCHIVE_COMMON_DIR"
           set this variable to the location of the common archive.

       "GPROFNG_JAVA_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH"
           set the depth of the Java call stack; the default is 256; set to 0 to disable capturing of call stacks.

       "GPROFNG_JAVA_NATIVE_MAX_CALL_STACK_DEPTH"
           set the depth of the Java native call stack; the default is 256; set to 0 to disable capturing of call stacks (JNI and
           assembly call stacks are not captured).

NOTES
       The gprofng driver supports the following commands.

       Collect performance data:

       "gprofng collect app"
           collect application performance data.

       Display the performance results:

       "gprofng display text"
           display the performance data in ASCII format.

       "gprofng display html"
           generate an HTML file from one or more experiments.

       Miscellaneous commands:

       "gprofng display src"
           display source or disassembly with compiler annotations.

       "gprofng archive"
           include binaries and source code in an experiment directory.

       It is also possible to invoke the lower level commands directly, but since these are subject to change, in particular the
       options, we recommend to use the driver.

SEE ALSO
       The man pages for the various gprofng commands are not available yet, but the --help option supported on each of the
       commands lists the options and provides more information.

       For example this displays the options supported on the gprofng collect app command:

               $ gprofng collect app --help

       The user guide is available as an Info entry for gprofng.
