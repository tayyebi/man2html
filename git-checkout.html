NAME
       git-checkout - Switch branches or restore working tree files

SYNOPSIS
       git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [&lt;branch&gt;]
       git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] --detach [&lt;branch&gt;]
       git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [--detach] &lt;commit&gt;
       git checkout [-q] [-f] [-m] [[-b|-B|--orphan] &lt;new-branch&gt;] [&lt;start-point&gt;]
       git checkout [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;pathspec&gt;...
       git checkout [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] --pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [--pathspec-file-nul]
       git checkout (-p|--patch) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]

DESCRIPTION
       Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, git
       checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.

       git checkout [&lt;branch&gt;]
           To prepare for working on &lt;branch&gt;, switch to it by updating the index and the files in the working tree, and by
           pointing HEAD at the branch. Local modifications to the files in the working tree are kept, so that they can be
           committed to the &lt;branch&gt;.

           If &lt;branch&gt; is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it &lt;remote&gt;) with a matching
           name and --no-guess is not specified, treat as equivalent to

               $ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;

           You could omit &lt;branch&gt;, in which case the command degenerates to "check out the current branch", which is a glorified
           no-op with rather expensive side-effects to show only the tracking information, if exists, for the current branch.

       git checkout -b|-B &lt;new-branch&gt; [&lt;start-point&gt;]
           Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if git-branch(1) were called and then checked out. In this case you
           can use the --track or --no-track options, which will be passed to git branch. As a convenience, --track without -b
           implies branch creation; see the description of --track below.

           If -B is given, &lt;new-branch&gt; is created if it doesn’t exist; otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional
           equivalent of

               $ git branch -f &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;start-point&gt;]
               $ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;

           that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless "git checkout" is successful.

       git checkout --detach [&lt;branch&gt;], git checkout [--detach] &lt;commit&gt;
           Prepare to work on top of &lt;commit&gt;, by detaching HEAD at it (see "DETACHED HEAD" section), and updating the index and
           the files in the working tree. Local modifications to the files in the working tree are kept, so that the resulting
           working tree will be the state recorded in the commit plus the local modifications.

           When the &lt;commit&gt; argument is a branch name, the --detach option can be used to detach HEAD at the tip of the branch
           (git checkout &lt;branch&gt; would check out that branch without detaching HEAD).

           Omitting &lt;branch&gt; detaches HEAD at the tip of the current branch.

       git checkout [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] &lt;pathspec&gt;..., git checkout
       [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] --pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [--pathspec-file-nul]
           Overwrite the contents of the files that match the pathspec. When the &lt;tree-ish&gt; (most often a commit) is not given,
           overwrite working tree with the contents in the index. When the &lt;tree-ish&gt; is given, overwrite both the index and the
           working tree with the contents at the &lt;tree-ish&gt;.

           The index may contain unmerged entries because of a previous failed merge. By default, if you try to check out such an
           entry from the index, the checkout operation will fail and nothing will be checked out. Using -f will ignore these
           unmerged entries. The contents from a specific side of the merge can be checked out of the index by using --ours or
           --theirs. With -m, changes made to the working tree file can be discarded to re-create the original conflicted merge
           result.

       git checkout (-p|--patch) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]
           This is similar to the previous mode, but lets you use the interactive interface to show the "diff" output and choose
           which hunks to use in the result. See below for the description of --patch option.

OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
           Quiet, suppress feedback messages.

       --progress, --no-progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless --quiet is
           specified. This flag enables progress reporting even if not attached to a terminal, regardless of --quiet.

       -f, --force
           When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from HEAD, and even if there are
           untracked files in the way. This is used to throw away local changes and any untracked files or directories that are in
           the way.

           When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged entries; instead, unmerged entries are ignored.

       --ours, --theirs
           When checking out paths from the index, check out stage #2 (ours) or #3 (theirs) for unmerged paths.

           Note that during git rebase and git pull --rebase, ours and theirs may appear swapped; --ours gives the version from the
           branch the changes are rebased onto, while --theirs gives the version from the branch that holds your work that is being
           rebased.

           This is because rebase is used in a workflow that treats the history at the remote as the shared canonical one, and
           treats the work done on the branch you are rebasing as the third-party work to be integrated, and you are temporarily
           assuming the role of the keeper of the canonical history during the rebase. As the keeper of the canonical history, you
           need to view the history from the remote as ours (i.e. "our shared canonical history"), while what you did on your side
           branch as theirs (i.e. "one contributor’s work on top of it").

       -b &lt;new-branch&gt;
           Create a new branch named &lt;new-branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start-point&gt;; see git-branch(1) for details.

       -B &lt;new-branch&gt;
           Creates the branch &lt;new-branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start-point&gt;; if it already exists, then reset it to &lt;start-point&gt;.
           This is equivalent to running "git branch" with "-f"; see git-branch(1) for details.

       -t, --track[=(direct|inherit)]
           When creating a new branch, set up "upstream" configuration. See "--track" in git-branch(1) for details.

           If no -b option is given, the name of the new branch will be derived from the remote-tracking branch, by looking at the
           local part of the refspec configured for the corresponding remote, and then stripping the initial part up to the "*".
           This would tell us to use hack as the local branch when branching off of origin/hack (or remotes/origin/hack, or even
           refs/remotes/origin/hack). If the given name has no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name, the guessing
           is aborted. You can explicitly give a name with -b in such a case.

       --no-track
           Do not set up "upstream" configuration, even if the branch.autoSetupMerge configuration variable is true.

       --guess, --no-guess
           If &lt;branch&gt; is not found but there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it &lt;remote&gt;) with a matching
           name, treat as equivalent to

               $ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;

           If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the checkout.defaultRemote configuration variable,
           we’ll use that one for the purposes of disambiguation, even if the &lt;branch&gt; isn’t unique across all remotes. Set it to
           e.g.  checkout.defaultRemote=origin to always checkout remote branches from there if &lt;branch&gt; is ambiguous but exists on
           the origin remote. See also checkout.defaultRemote in git-config(1).

           --guess is the default behavior. Use --no-guess to disable it.

           The default behavior can be set via the checkout.guess configuration variable.

       -l
           Create the new branch’s reflog; see git-branch(1) for details.

       -d, --detach
           Rather than checking out a branch to work on it, check out a commit for inspection and discardable experiments. This is
           the default behavior of git checkout &lt;commit&gt; when &lt;commit&gt; is not a branch name. See the "DETACHED HEAD" section below
           for details.

       --orphan &lt;new-branch&gt;
           Create a new orphan branch, named &lt;new-branch&gt;, started from &lt;start-point&gt; and switch to it. The first commit made on
           this new branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new history totally disconnected from all the other
           branches and commits.

           The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run git checkout &lt;start-point&gt;. This allows you to
           start a new history that records a set of paths similar to &lt;start-point&gt; by easily running git commit -a to make the
           root commit.

           This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit without exposing its full history. You might want to
           do this to publish an open source branch of a project whose current tree is "clean", but whose full history contains
           proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of code.

           If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of paths that is totally different from the one of
           &lt;start-point&gt;, then you should clear the index and the working tree right after creating the orphan branch by running
           git rm -rf .  from the top level of the working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files,
           repopulating the working tree, by copying them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.

       --ignore-skip-worktree-bits
           In sparse checkout mode, git checkout -- &lt;paths&gt; would update only entries matched by &lt;paths&gt; and sparse patterns in
           $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout. This option ignores the sparse patterns and adds back any files in &lt;paths&gt;.

       -m, --merge
           When switching branches, if you have local modifications to one or more files that are different between the current
           branch and the branch to which you are switching, the command refuses to switch branches in order to preserve your
           modifications in context. However, with this option, a three-way merge between the current branch, your working tree
           contents, and the new branch is done, and you will be on the new branch.

           When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting paths are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the
           conflicts and mark the resolved paths with git add (or git rm if the merge should result in deletion of the path).

           When checking out paths from the index, this option lets you recreate the conflicted merge in the specified paths.

           When switching branches with --merge, staged changes may be lost.

       --conflict=&lt;style&gt;
           The same as --merge option above, but changes the way the conflicting hunks are presented, overriding the
           merge.conflictStyle configuration variable. Possible values are "merge" (default), "diff3", and "zdiff3".

       -p, --patch
           Interactively select hunks in the difference between the &lt;tree-ish&gt; (or the index, if unspecified) and the working tree.
           The chosen hunks are then applied in reverse to the working tree (and if a &lt;tree-ish&gt; was specified, the index).

           This means that you can use git checkout -p to selectively discard edits from your current working tree. See the
           “Interactive Mode” section of git-add(1) to learn how to operate the --patch mode.

           Note that this option uses the no overlay mode by default (see also --overlay), and currently doesn’t support overlay
           mode.

       --ignore-other-worktrees
           git checkout refuses when the wanted ref is already checked out by another worktree. This option makes it check the ref
           out anyway. In other words, the ref can be held by more than one worktree.

       --overwrite-ignore, --no-overwrite-ignore
           Silently overwrite ignored files when switching branches. This is the default behavior. Use --no-overwrite-ignore to
           abort the operation when the new branch contains ignored files.

       --recurse-submodules, --no-recurse-submodules
           Using --recurse-submodules will update the content of all active submodules according to the commit recorded in the
           superproject. If local modifications in a submodule would be overwritten the checkout will fail unless -f is used. If
           nothing (or --no-recurse-submodules) is used, submodules working trees will not be updated. Just like git-submodule(1),
           this will detach HEAD of the submodule.

       --overlay, --no-overlay
           In the default overlay mode, git checkout never removes files from the index or the working tree. When specifying
           --no-overlay, files that appear in the index and working tree, but not in &lt;tree-ish&gt; are removed, to make them match
           &lt;tree-ish&gt; exactly.

       --pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;
           Pathspec is passed in &lt;file&gt; instead of commandline args. If &lt;file&gt; is exactly - then standard input is used. Pathspec
           elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained for the configuration variable
           core.quotePath (see git-config(1)). See also --pathspec-file-nul and global --literal-pathspecs.

       --pathspec-file-nul
           Only meaningful with --pathspec-from-file. Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all other characters
           are taken literally (including newlines and quotes).

       &lt;branch&gt;
           Branch to checkout; if it refers to a branch (i.e., a name that, when prepended with "refs/heads/", is a valid ref),
           then that branch is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit, your HEAD becomes "detached" and you are no
           longer on any branch (see below for details).

           You can use the @{-N} syntax to refer to the N-th last branch/commit checked out using "git checkout" operation. You may
           also specify - which is synonymous to @{-1}.

           As a special case, you may use A...B as a shortcut for the merge base of A and B if there is exactly one merge base. You
           can leave out at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;new-branch&gt;
           Name for the new branch.

       &lt;start-point&gt;
           The name of a commit at which to start the new branch; see git-branch(1) for details. Defaults to HEAD.

           As a special case, you may use "A...B" as a shortcut for the merge base of A and B if there is exactly one merge base.
           You can leave out at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;tree-ish&gt;
           Tree to checkout from (when paths are given). If not specified, the index will be used.

           As a special case, you may use "A...B" as a shortcut for the merge base of A and B if there is exactly one merge base.
           You can leave out at most one of A and B, in which case it defaults to HEAD.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       &lt;pathspec&gt;...
           Limits the paths affected by the operation.

           For more details, see the pathspec entry in gitglossary(7).

DETACHED HEAD
       HEAD normally refers to a named branch (e.g. master). Meanwhile, each branch refers to a specific commit. Let’s look at a
       repo with three commits, one of them tagged, and with branch master checked out:

                      HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
                       |
                       v
           a---b---c  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'c')
               ^
               |
             tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')

       When a commit is created in this state, the branch is updated to refer to the new commit. Specifically, git commit creates a
       new commit d, whose parent is commit c, and then updates branch master to refer to new commit d. HEAD still refers to branch
       master and so indirectly now refers to commit d:

           $ edit; git add; git commit

                          HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
                           |
                           v
           a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
               ^
               |
             tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')

       It is sometimes useful to be able to checkout a commit that is not at the tip of any named branch, or even to create a new
       commit that is not referenced by a named branch. Let’s look at what happens when we checkout commit b (here we show two ways
       this may be done):

           $ git checkout v2.0  # or
           $ git checkout master^^

              HEAD (refers to commit 'b')
               |
               v
           a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
               ^
               |
             tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')

       Notice that regardless of which checkout command we use, HEAD now refers directly to commit b. This is known as being in
       detached HEAD state. It means simply that HEAD refers to a specific commit, as opposed to referring to a named branch. Let’s
       see what happens when we create a commit:

           $ edit; git add; git commit

                HEAD (refers to commit 'e')
                 |
                 v
                 e
                /
           a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
               ^
               |
             tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')

       There is now a new commit e, but it is referenced only by HEAD. We can of course add yet another commit in this state:

           $ edit; git add; git commit

                    HEAD (refers to commit 'f')
                     |
                     v
                 e---f
                /
           a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
               ^
               |
             tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')

       In fact, we can perform all the normal Git operations. But, let’s look at what happens when we then checkout master:

           $ git checkout master

                          HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
                 e---f     |
                /          v
           a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
               ^
               |
             tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')

       It is important to realize that at this point nothing refers to commit f. Eventually commit f (and by extension commit e)
       will be deleted by the routine Git garbage collection process, unless we create a reference before that happens. If we have
       not yet moved away from commit f, any of these will create a reference to it:

           $ git checkout -b foo   (1)
           $ git branch foo        (2)
           $ git tag foo           (3)

       1. creates a new branch foo, which refers to commit f, and then updates HEAD to refer to branch foo. In other words, we’ll
       no longer be in detached HEAD state after this command.
       2. similarly creates a new branch foo, which refers to commit f, but leaves HEAD detached.
       3. creates a new tag foo, which refers to commit f, leaving HEAD detached.

       If we have moved away from commit f, then we must first recover its object name (typically by using git reflog), and then we
       can create a reference to it. For example, to see the last two commits to which HEAD referred, we can use either of these
       commands:

           $ git reflog -2 HEAD # or
           $ git log -g -2 HEAD

ARGUMENT DISAMBIGUATION
       When there is only one argument given and it is not -- (e.g. git checkout abc), and when the argument is both a valid
       &lt;tree-ish&gt; (e.g. a branch abc exists) and a valid &lt;pathspec&gt; (e.g. a file or a directory whose name is "abc" exists), Git
       would usually ask you to disambiguate. Because checking out a branch is so common an operation, however, git checkout abc
       takes "abc" as a &lt;tree-ish&gt; in such a situation. Use git checkout -- &lt;pathspec&gt; if you want to checkout these paths out of
       the index.

EXAMPLES
        1. The following sequence checks out the master branch, reverts the Makefile to two revisions back, deletes hello.c by
           mistake, and gets it back from the index.

               $ git checkout master             (1)
               $ git checkout master~2 Makefile  (2)
               $ rm -f hello.c
               $ git checkout hello.c            (3)

           1. switch branch
           2. take a file out of another commit
           3. restore hello.c from the index

           If you want to check out all C source files out of the index, you can say

               $ git checkout -- '*.c'

           Note the quotes around *.c. The file hello.c will also be checked out, even though it is no longer in the working tree,
           because the file globbing is used to match entries in the index (not in the working tree by the shell).

           If you have an unfortunate branch that is named hello.c, this step would be confused as an instruction to switch to that
           branch. You should instead write:

               $ git checkout -- hello.c

        2. After working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct branch would be done using:

               $ git checkout mytopic

           However, your "wrong" branch and correct mytopic branch may differ in files that you have modified locally, in which
           case the above checkout would fail like this:

               $ git checkout mytopic
               error: You have local changes to 'frotz'; not switching branches.

           You can give the -m flag to the command, which would try a three-way merge:

               $ git checkout -m mytopic
               Auto-merging frotz

           After this three-way merge, the local modifications are not registered in your index file, so git diff would show you
           what changes you made since the tip of the new branch.

        3. When a merge conflict happens during switching branches with the -m option, you would see something like this:

               $ git checkout -m mytopic
               Auto-merging frotz
               ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz
               fatal: merge program failed

           At this point, git diff shows the changes cleanly merged as in the previous example, as well as the changes in the
           conflicted files. Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved with git add as usual:

               $ edit frotz
               $ git add frotz

CONFIGURATION
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the git-config(1) documentation. The content is the
       same as what’s found there:

       checkout.defaultRemote
           When you run git checkout &lt;something&gt; or git switch &lt;something&gt; and only have one remote, it may implicitly fall back on
           checking out and tracking e.g.  origin/&lt;something&gt;. This stops working as soon as you have more than one remote with a
           &lt;something&gt; reference. This setting allows for setting the name of a preferred remote that should always win when it
           comes to disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to origin.

           Currently this is used by git-switch(1) and git-checkout(1) when git checkout &lt;something&gt; or git switch &lt;something&gt; will
           checkout the &lt;something&gt; branch on another remote, and by git-worktree(1) when git worktree add refers to a remote
           branch. This setting might be used for other checkout-like commands or functionality in the future.

       checkout.guess
           Provides the default value for the --guess or --no-guess option in git checkout and git switch. See git-switch(1) and
           git-checkout(1).

       checkout.workers
           The number of parallel workers to use when updating the working tree. The default is one, i.e. sequential execution. If
           set to a value less than one, Git will use as many workers as the number of logical cores available. This setting and
           checkout.thresholdForParallelism affect all commands that perform checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset,
           sparse-checkout, etc.

           Note: parallel checkout usually delivers better performance for repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For
           repositories on spinning disks and/or machines with a small number of cores, the default sequential checkout often
           performs better. The size and compression level of a repository might also influence how well the parallel version
           performs.

       checkout.thresholdForParallelism
           When running parallel checkout with a small number of files, the cost of subprocess spawning and inter-process
           communication might outweigh the parallelization gains. This setting allows to define the minimum number of files for
           which parallel checkout should be attempted. The default is 100.
