NAME
       console-setup - configuration file for setupcon

DESCRIPTION
       The  file console-setup specifies the encoding and the font to be used by setupcon(1) in order to setup the console.  It can
       be used also to specify the keyboard layout but it is not recommended to do so, use keyboard(5) instead.

       The font specification consists of three parameters - codeset, font face and font size.  The codeset specifies what  charac‐
       ters  will  be  supported  by the font.  There isn't one-to-one correspondence between codeset and encoding, for example the
       codeset Lat15 is suitable for ISO 8859-1, ISO 8859-9 and ISO 8859-15.  The codesets are two kinds -  small  and  big.   Only
       small codesets are supported on FreeBSD.

       The  font  face determines the general look of the font.  Each font face is available in certain possible sizes.  On FreeBSD
       only 8x16, 8x14 and 8x8 are valid sizes.  On Linux if framebuffer is not used or consolechars(1)  is  installed  instead  of
       setfont(1), then the permitted sizes have the form 8xNUMBER.

       The console driver of FreeBSD permits fonts in different sizes to be simultaneously loaded.  Which one of them will be actu‐
       ally used depends on the current video mode.  Therefore, on this platform the font size specification will  be  ignored  and
       setupcon(1) will load the selected font face in all available sizes.

       The file console-setup consists of variable settings in POSIX format:

              VARIABLE='VALUE'

       Only one assignment is allowed per line.  Comments (starting with '#') are also allowed.

OPTIONS
       The following variables can be set.

       ACTIVE_CONSOLES
              Specifies  the  device files in /dev of the virtual terminals to be configured.  File name wild-cards (*, ?)  are al‐
              lowed.  On Linux usually you can set this to /dev/tty[1-6] and on FreeBSD a sensible value  is  /dev/ttyv[0-8].   You
              can  assign  to this variable also the special value guess.  It will cause setupcon(1) to attempt to guess the active
              virtual consoles by looking in configuration files such as /etc/inittab and /etc/ttys.  This guessing is  not  always
              reliable.

       CHARMAP
              Specifies the desired encoding on the console.  Valid values are: UTF-8, ARMSCII-8, CP1251, CP1255, CP1256, GEORGIAN-
              ACADEMY, GEORGIAN-PS, IBM1133, ISIRI-3342, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3,  ISO-8859-4,  ISO-8859-5,  ISO-8859-6,
              ISO-8859-7,  ISO-8859-8,  ISO-8859-9,  ISO-8859-10,  ISO-8859-11, ISO-8859-13, ISO-8859-14, ISO-8859-15, ISO-8859-16,
              KOI8-R, KOI8-U, TIS-620 and VISCII.  The special value guess is also recognized in which case the system command  lo‐
              cale(1) will be used to guess the desired encoding (currently this works reliably only with GNU libc).

       CODESET
              In most cases the special value guess can be used here in which case a suitable codeset will be guessed.  The codeset
              determines which symbols are supported by the font.  Valid small codesets are: Armenian,  CyrAsia,  CyrKoi,  CyrSlav,
              Georgian,  Greek,  Hebrew,  Lao, Lat15, Lat2, Lat38, Lat7 and Thai.  Valid big codesets are: Arabic, Ethiopian, Uni1,
              Uni2, Uni3 and Vietnamese.  Only small codesets can be used on FreeBSD.  See below the  section  entitled  “CODESETS”
              for detailed description of each of these codesets.

       FONTFACE and FONTSIZE
              Valid  font  faces are: VGA (sizes 8x8, 8x14, 8x16, 16x28 and 16x32), Terminus (sizes 6x12, 8x14, 8x16, 10x20, 12x24,
              14x28 and 16x32), TerminusBold (sizes 8x14, 8x16, 10x20, 12x24, 14x28 and 16x32),  TerminusBoldVGA  (sizes  8x14  and
              8x16),  and  Fixed  (sizes  8x13,  8x14, 8x15, 8x16 and 8x18).  If however CODESET=Ethiopian, then the available font
              faces are Goha and GohaClassic, each in sizes 8x12, 8x14 and 8x16.

              Set FONTFACE and FONTSIZE to empty strings if you want to configure only the keyboard and to leave the  console  font
              unchanged.

       VIDEOMODE
              Set VIDEOMODE to an empty string to avoid setting up the video mode.  On FreeBSD you can run

                  vidcontrol -i mode

              in  order to see all possible video modes.  On Linux fbset(1) is used to configure the video mode but very often this
              doesn't work because the default framebuffer driver (VesaFB) is rather limited and doesn't allow changes of the video
              mode.

       FONT, FONT_MAP and CONSOLE_MAP
              If set, specify that a non standard font is to be used.  The value of the variable FONT consists of one or more space
              separated font file names.  On Linux, when the font doesn't contain embedded Unicode map,  an  external  map  can  be
              specified  with  the variable FONT_MAP.  The value of CONSOLE_MAP is a file that specifies a translation map from the
              user's 8-bit encoding to Unicode (Linux only) or directly to font positions.

       SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT
              If set, these variables specify a screen size that setupcon(1) will enforce with stty(1).  This can  be  useful  with
              some  braille devices that are only 40 cells wide.  The screen size can not exceed what the current screen resolution
              can display according to the size of the loaded font.

       BEEP   This variable controls the style of the system beep on the console.  When unset or when BEEP=default  no  changes  to
              the  system  beep  will be made.  Other possible values of BEEP are: standard - set a standard beep; short - like the
              standard beep but somewhat shorter; shortest - even more short, suitable when your work generates lots of beeps;  po‐
              lite  -  a  very  short beep with low frequency, suitable when there are other people in the room; attention - a very
              long beep, suitable when you want to warn yourself about an occurring event; annoying - also a  long  beep,  suitable
              when you want to warn somebody else about an occurring event; and off - disable the system beep on the console.

CODESETS
       There are two kinds of codesets - small (up to 256 symbols) and big (up to 512 symbols).  Only small codesets can be used on
       FreeBSD.  When the screen is in text mode (i.e. framebuffer is not used) then fonts covering big codesets  will  reduce  the
       number of available foreground colors.

FILES
       The  standard location of the console-setup configuration file is /etc/default/console-setup.  The keyboard configuration is
       in /etc/default/keyboard.  Fonts that can be used with the variable FONT are usually installed  in  /usr/share/consolefonts/
       or  /usr/share/syscons/fonts/.   Translation  maps  that  can be used with the variable CONSOLE_MAP are usually installed in
       /usr/share/consoletrans/ or /usr/share/syscons/scrnmaps/.

NOTES
       The aim of the Terminus font is to reduce the eyes-fatigue when one has to read a lot.  Currently this  font  supports  only
       the  Latin,  the Cyrillic and the Greek scripts (the Lat15, Lat2, Lat7, CyrAsia, CyrKoi, CyrSlav, Greek, Uni2 and Uni3 code‐
       sets).

       The fonts with font face TerminusBoldVGA are optimized for use with regular text video modes.  They should not be used  with
       framebuffer video modes.  The fonts with font face TerminusBold are optimized for use with the framebuffer video modes.  The
       fonts with font face Terminus can be used in all video modes.
