NAME
       git-cherry - Find commits yet to be applied to upstream

SYNOPSIS
       git cherry [-v] [&lt;upstream&gt; [&lt;head&gt; [&lt;limit&gt;]]]

DESCRIPTION
       Determine whether there are commits in &lt;head&gt;..&lt;upstream&gt; that are equivalent to those in the range &lt;limit&gt;..&lt;head&gt;.

       The equivalence test is based on the diff, after removing whitespace and line numbers. git-cherry therefore detects when
       commits have been "copied" by means of git-cherry-pick(1), git-am(1) or git-rebase(1).

       Outputs the SHA1 of every commit in &lt;limit&gt;..&lt;head&gt;, prefixed with - for commits that have an equivalent in &lt;upstream&gt;, and
       + for commits that do not.

OPTIONS
       -v
           Show the commit subjects next to the SHA1s.

       &lt;upstream&gt;
           Upstream branch to search for equivalent commits. Defaults to the upstream branch of HEAD.

       &lt;head&gt;
           Working branch; defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;limit&gt;
           Do not report commits up to (and including) limit.

EXAMPLES
   Patch workflows
       git-cherry is frequently used in patch-based workflows (see gitworkflows(7)) to determine if a series of patches has been
       applied by the upstream maintainer. In such a workflow you might create and send a topic branch like this:

           $ git checkout -b topic origin/master
           # work and create some commits
           $ git format-patch origin/master
           $ git send-email ... 00*

       Later, you can see whether your changes have been applied by saying (still on topic):

           $ git fetch  # update your notion of origin/master
           $ git cherry -v

   Concrete example
       In a situation where topic consisted of three commits, and the maintainer applied two of them, the situation might look
       like:

           $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --boundary origin/master...topic
           * 7654321 (origin/master) upstream tip commit
           [... snip some other commits ...]
           * cccc111 cherry-pick of C
           * aaaa111 cherry-pick of A
           [... snip a lot more that has happened ...]
           | * cccc000 (topic) commit C
           | * bbbb000 commit B
           | * aaaa000 commit A
           |/
           o 1234567 branch point

       In such cases, git-cherry shows a concise summary of what has yet to be applied:

           $ git cherry origin/master topic
           - cccc000... commit C
           + bbbb000... commit B
           - aaaa000... commit A

       Here, we see that the commits A and C (marked with -) can be dropped from your topic branch when you rebase it on top of
       origin/master, while the commit B (marked with +) still needs to be kept so that it will be sent to be applied to
       origin/master.

   Using a limit
       The optional &lt;limit&gt; is useful in cases where your topic is based on other work that is not in upstream. Expanding on the
       previous example, this might look like:

           $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --boundary origin/master...topic
           * 7654321 (origin/master) upstream tip commit
           [... snip some other commits ...]
           * cccc111 cherry-pick of C
           * aaaa111 cherry-pick of A
           [... snip a lot more that has happened ...]
           | * cccc000 (topic) commit C
           | * bbbb000 commit B
           | * aaaa000 commit A
           | * 0000fff (base) unpublished stuff F
           [... snip ...]
           | * 0000aaa unpublished stuff A
           |/
           o 1234567 merge-base between upstream and topic

       By specifying base as the limit, you can avoid listing commits between base and topic:

           $ git cherry origin/master topic base
           - cccc000... commit C
           + bbbb000... commit B
           - aaaa000... commit A
