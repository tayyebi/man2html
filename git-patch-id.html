NAME
       git-patch-id - Compute unique ID for a patch

SYNOPSIS
       git patch-id [--stable | --unstable | --verbatim]

DESCRIPTION
       Read a patch from the standard input and compute the patch ID for it.

       A "patch ID" is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file diffs associated with a patch, with line numbers ignored. As such,
       it’s "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., two patches that have the same "patch ID" are
       almost guaranteed to be the same thing.

       The main usecase for this command is to look for likely duplicate commits.

       When dealing with git diff-tree output, it takes advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of
       the commit, and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch ID, and the second string is the
       commit ID. This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.

OPTIONS
       --verbatim
           Calculate the patch-id of the input as it is given, do not strip any whitespace.

               This is the default if patchid.verbatim is true.

       --stable
           Use a "stable" sum of hashes as the patch ID. With this option:

           •   Reordering file diffs that make up a patch does not affect the ID. In particular, two patches produced by comparing
               the same two trees with two different settings for "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;" result in the same patch ID signature, thereby
               allowing the computed result to be used as a key to index some meta-information about the change between the two
               trees;

           •   Result is different from the value produced by git 1.9 and older or produced when an "unstable" hash (see --unstable
               below) is configured - even when used on a diff output taken without any use of "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;", thereby making
               existing databases storing such "unstable" or historical patch-ids unusable.

           •   All whitespace within the patch is ignored and does not affect the id.

                   This is the default if patchid.stable is set to true.

       --unstable
           Use an "unstable" hash as the patch ID. With this option, the result produced is compatible with the patch-id value
           produced by git 1.9 and older and whitespace is ignored. Users with pre-existing databases storing patch-ids produced by
           git 1.9 and older (who do not deal with reordered patches) may want to use this option.

               This is the default.
