NAME
       dpkg-genbuildinfo - generate Debian .buildinfo files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-genbuildinfo [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-genbuildinfo reads information from an unpacked and built Debian source tree and from the files it has generated and
       generates a Debian control file describing the build environment and the build artifacts (.buildinfo file).

       This command was introduced in dpkg 1.18.11.

OPTIONS
       --build=type
           Specifies the build type from a comma-separated list of components.

           The allowed values are:

           any Generate build information including unqualified build dependencies (Build-Depends) and architecture specific build
               dependencies (Build-Depends-Arch).

           all Generate build information including unqualified build dependencies (Build-Depends) and architecture independent
               build dependencies (Build-Depends-Indep).

           source
               Effectively ignored; generate build information with just the unqualified build dependencies (Build-Depends).

           binary
               Generate build information with all three types of build dependencies.  This is an alias for any,all.

           full
               Generate build information with all three types of build dependencies.  This is an alias for any,all,source, and the
               same as the default case when no build option is specified.

       -ccontrolfile
           Specifies the main source control file to read information from. The default is debian/control.

       -lchangelog-file
           Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The default is debian/changelog.

       -ffiles-list-file
           Specifies where is the list of files that have been produced by the build, rather than using debian/files.

       -Fchangelog-format
           Specifies the format of the changelog. See dpkg-parsechangelog(1) for information about alternative formats.

       -O[filename]
           Print the buildinfo file to standard output (or filename if specified) rather than to dir/source-name_binary-
           version_arch.buildinfo (where dir is .. by default or upload-files-dir if -u was used).

       -uupload-files-dir
           Look for the files to be uploaded in upload-files-dir rather than ..  (dpkg-genbuildinfo needs to find these files so
           that it can include their sizes and checksums in the .buildinfo file).

       --always-include-kernel
           By default, the Build-Kernel-Version field will not be written out.

           Specify this option (since dpkg 1.19.0) to always write a Build-Kernel-Version field when generating the .buildinfo.

       --always-include-path
           By default, the Build-Path field will only be written if the current directory starts with an allowed pattern.

           On Debian and derivatives the pattern matches on /build/ at the start of the pathname.

           Specify this option to always write a Build-Path field when generating the .buildinfo.

       --admindir=dir
           Change the location of the dpkg database. The default location is /var/lib/dpkg.

       -q  dpkg-genbuildinfo might produce informative messages on standard error.  -q suppresses these messages.

       -?, --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
           This variable can be used to enable or disable various features that affect the information included in the .buildinfo
           file, via the buildinfo option (since dpkg 1.18.19).  This option contains a comma-separated list of features, prefixed
           with the ‘+’ or ‘-’ modifiers, to denote whether to enable or disable them.  The special feature “all” can be used to
           enable or disable all other features.  The feature “path” controls whether to unconditionally include the Build-Path
           field.

       DPKG_COLORS
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.

       DPKG_NLS
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are: 0 and 1 (default).

FILES
       debian/files
           The list of generated files.  dpkg-genbuildinfo reads the data here when producing a .buildinfo file.

SEE ALSO
       deb-buildinfo(5).
