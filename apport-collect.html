<pre>apport-bug(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                         apport-bug(1)

NAME
       apport-bug, apport-collect - file a bug report using Apport, or update an existing report

SYNOPSIS
       apport-bug

       apport-bug symptom | pid | package | program path | .apport/.crash file

       apport-collect report-number

DESCRIPTION
       apport-bug  reports  problems to your distribution's bug tracking system, using Apport to collect a lot of local information
       about your system to help the developers to fix the problem and avoid unnecessary question/answer turnarounds.

       You should always start with running apport-bug without arguments, which will present a list of known  symptoms.  This  will
       generate the most useful bug reports.

       If  there  is no matching symptom, you need to determine the affected program or package yourself. You can provide a package
       name or program name to apport-bug, e. g.:

           apport-bug firefox
           apport-bug /usr/bin/unzip

       In order to add more information to the bug report that could help the developers to fix the problem, you can also specify a
       process ID instead:

           $ pidof gnome-terminal
           5139
           $ apport-bug 5139

       As a special case, to report a bug against the Linux kernel, you do not need to use the full package name (such as linux-im‚Äê
       age-2.6.28-4-generic); you can just use

           apport-bug linux

       to report a bug against the currently running kernel.

       Finally, you can use this program to report a previously stored crash or bug report:

           apport-bug /var/crash/_bin_bash.1000.crash
           apport-bug /tmp/apport.firefox.332G9t.apport

       Bug reports can be written to a file by using the --save option  or by using apport-cli.

       apport-bug detects whether KDE or Gnome is running and calls apport-gtk or apport-kde accordingly. If neither is  available,
       or the session does not run under X11, it calls apport-cli for a command-line client.

UPDATING EXISTING REPORTS
       apport-collect  collects  the same information as apport-bug, but adds it to an already reported problem you have submitted.
       This is useful if the report was not originally filed through Apport, and the developers ask you to attach information  from
       your system.

OPTIONS
       Please see the apport-cli(1) manpage for possible options.

ENVIRONMENT
       APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES
              Apport refuses to create bug reports if the package or any dependency is not current. If this environment variable is
              set, this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the situation before filing a bug report can define this
              in their ~/.bashrc or temporarily on the command line when calling apport-bug.

FILES
       apport  crash  files  are  written  in  to  /var/crash by default, named uniquely per binary name and user id.  They are not
       deleted after being sent to the bug tracker (but from cron when they get older than 7 days). You can extract the  core  file
       (if any) and other information using apport-unpack.
