DESCRIPTION
       The  dotnet test command is used to execute unit tests in a given solution.  The dotnet test command builds the solution and
       runs a test host application for each test project in the solution.  The test host executes tests in the given project using
       a  test  framework, for example: MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit, and reports the success or failure of each test.  If all tests are
       successful, the test runner returns 0 as an exit code; otherwise if any test fails, it returns 1.

       For multi-targeted projects, tests are run for each targeted framework.  The test host and the unit test framework are pack‐
       aged as NuGet packages and are restored as ordinary dependencies for the project.

       Test  projects specify the test runner using an ordinary &lt;PackageReference&gt; element, as seen in the following sample project
       file:

       [!code-xmlXUnit Basic Template]

       Where Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk is the test host, xunit is  the  test  framework.   And  xunit.runner.visualstudio  is  a  test
       adapter, which allows the xUnit framework to work with the test host.

   Implicit restore
       You  don’t  have  to run dotnet restore because it’s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to occur, such as
       dotnet new, dotnet build, dotnet run, dotnet test, dotnet publish, and dotnet pack.  To disable implicit  restore,  use  the
       --no-restore option.

       The  dotnet  restore command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring makes sense, such as continuous
       integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicitly control when the restore occurs.

       For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the dotnet restore documentation.

   Workload manifest downloads
       When you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads.  If  the
       download  is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For more information, see Advertising mani‐
       fests.

ARGUMENTS
       • PROJECT | SOLUTION | DIRECTORY | DLL | EXE

         • Path to the test project.

         • Path to the solution.

         • Path to a directory that contains a project or a solution.

         • Path to a test project .dll file.

         • Path to a test project .exe file.

         If not specified, the effect is the same as using the DIRECTORY argument to specify the current directory.

OPTIONS
              [!WARNING] Breaking changes in options:

              • Starting in .NET 7: switch -a to alias --arch instead of --test-adapter-path

              • Starting in .NET 7: switch -r to alias --runtime instead of --results-dir

       • --test-adapter-path &lt;ADAPTER_PATH&gt;

         Path to a directory to be searched for additional test adapters.  Only .dll files with  suffix  .TestAdapter.dll  are  in‐
         spected.  If not specified, the directory of the test .dll is searched.

         Short form -a available in .NET SDK versions earlier than 7.

       • --arch &lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;

         Specifies the target architecture.  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime Identifier (RID), where the provid‐
         ed value is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --arch x86 sets the RID to  win-
         x86.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6 Preview 7.

       • --blame

         Runs  the  tests  in blame mode.  This option is helpful in isolating problematic tests that cause the test host to crash.
         When a crash is detected, it creates a sequence file in TestResults/&lt;Guid&gt;/&lt;Guid&gt;_Sequence.xml that captures the order  of
         tests that were run before the crash.

         This option does not create a memory dump and is not helpful when the test is hanging.

       • --blame-crash (Available since .NET 5.0 SDK)

         Runs  the tests in blame mode and collects a crash dump when the test host exits unexpectedly.  This option depends on the
         version of .NET used, the type of error, and the operating system.

         For exceptions in managed code, a dump will be automatically collected on .NET 5.0 and later versions.  It will generate a
         dump  for testhost or any child process that also ran on .NET 5.0 and crashed.  Crashes in native code will not generate a
         dump.  This option works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

         Crash dumps in native code, or when using .NET Core 3.1 or earlier versions, can only be collected on  Windows,  by  using
         Procdump.   A  directory  that  contains  procdump.exe and procdump64.exe must be in the PATH or PROCDUMP_PATH environment
         variable.  Download the tools.  Implies --blame.

         To collect a crash dump from a native application running on .NET 5.0 or later, the usage of Procdump  can  be  forced  by
         setting the VSTEST_DUMP_FORCEPROCDUMP environment variable to 1.

       • --blame-crash-dump-type &lt;DUMP_TYPE&gt; (Available since .NET 5.0 SDK)

         The type of crash dump to be collected.  Supported dump types are full (default), and mini.  Implies --blame-crash.

       • --blame-crash-collect-always (Available since .NET 5.0 SDK)

         Collects a crash dump on expected as well as unexpected test host exit.

       • --blame-hang (Available since .NET 5.0 SDK)

         Run the tests in blame mode and collects a hang dump when a test exceeds the given timeout.

       • --blame-hang-dump-type &lt;DUMP_TYPE&gt; (Available since .NET 5.0 SDK)

         The type of crash dump to be collected.  It should be full, mini, or none.  When none is specified, test host is terminat‐
         ed on timeout, but no dump is collected.  Implies --blame-hang.

       • --blame-hang-timeout &lt;TIMESPAN&gt; (Available since .NET 5.0 SDK)

         Per-test timeout, after which a hang dump is triggered and the test host process and all of its child processes are dumped
         and terminated.  The timeout value is specified in one of the following formats:

         • 1.5h, 1.5hour, 1.5hours

         • 90m, 90min, 90minute, 90minutes

         • 5400s, 5400sec, 5400second, 5400seconds

         • 5400000ms, 5400000mil, 5400000millisecond, 5400000milliseconds

         When  no  unit  is  used (for example, 5400000), the value is assumed to be in milliseconds.  When used together with data
         driven tests, the timeout behavior depends on the test adapter used.  For xUnit, NUnit.  and MSTest 2.2.4+, the timeout is
         renewed  after  every test case.  For MSTest before version 2.2.4, the timeout is used for all test cases.  This option is
         supported on Windows with netcoreapp2.1 and later, on Linux with netcoreapp3.1 and later, and on macOS with net5.0 or lat‐
         er.  Implies --blame and --blame-hang.

       • -c|--configuration &lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;

         Defines  the  build  configuration.   The default for most projects is Debug, but you can override the build configuration
         settings in your project.

       • --collect &lt;DATA_COLLECTOR_NAME&gt;

         Enables data collector for the test run.  For more information, see Monitor and analyze test  run  (https://aka.ms/vstest-
         collect).

         On  Windows  (x86, x64 and Arm64), Linux (x64) and macOS (x64), you can collect code coverage by using the --collect "Code
         Coverage" option.  For more information, see Use code coverage and Customize code coverage analysis.

         To collect code coverage on any platform that is supported by .NET Core,  install  Coverlet  (https://github.com/coverlet-
         coverage/coverlet/blob/master/README.md) and use the --collect "XPlat Code Coverage" option.

       • -d|--diag &lt;LOG_FILE&gt;

         Enables  diagnostic  mode  for the test platform and writes diagnostic messages to the specified file and to files next to
         it.  The process that is logging the messages determines which files are created, such as *.host_&lt;date&gt;.txt for test  host
         log, and *.datacollector_&lt;date&gt;.txt for data collector log.

       • -e|--environment &lt;NAME="VALUE"&gt;

         Sets the value of an environment variable.  Creates the variable if it does not exist, overrides if it does exist.  Use of
         this option will force the tests to be run in an isolated process.  The option can be specified multiple times to  provide
         multiple variables.

       • -f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;

         The  target framework moniker (TFM) of the target framework to run tests for.  The target framework must also be specified
         in the project file.

       • --filter &lt;EXPRESSION&gt;

         Filters out tests in the current project using the given expression.  For more information, see the Filter option  details
         section.  For more information and examples on how to use selective unit test filtering, see Running selective unit tests.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --interactive

         Allows  the  command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.  Available since
         .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • -l|--logger &lt;LOGGER&gt;

         Specifies a logger for test results.  Unlike MSBuild, dotnet test  doesn’t  accept  abbreviations:  instead  of  -l  "con‐
         sole;v=d" use -l "console;verbosity=detailed".  Specify the parameter multiple times to enable multiple loggers.  For more
         information, see Reporting test results (https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-docs/blob/main/docs/report.md), Switches  for
         loggers, and the examples later in this article.

       • --no-build

         Doesn’t build the test project before running it.  It also implicitly sets the --no-restore flag.

       • --nologo

         Run tests without displaying the Microsoft TestPlatform banner.  Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • --no-restore

         Doesn’t execute an implicit restore when running the command.

       • -o|--output &lt;OUTPUT_DIRECTORY&gt;

         Directory in which to find the binaries to run.  If not specified, the default path is ./bin/&lt;configuration&gt;/&lt;framework&gt;/.
         For projects with multiple target frameworks (via the TargetFrameworks property), you also need to define --framework when
         you  specify  this  option.   dotnet  test  always  runs tests from the output directory.  You can use &lt;xref:System.AppDo‐
         main.BaseDirectory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt; to consume test assets in the output directory.

       • --os &lt;OS&gt;

         Specifies the target operating system (OS).  This is a shorthand syntax for setting the Runtime  Identifier  (RID),  where
         the  provided  value  is combined with the default RID.  For example, on a win-x64 machine, specifying --os linux sets the
         RID to linux-x64.  If you use this option, don’t use the -r|--runtime option.  Available since .NET 6.

       • --results-directory &lt;RESULTS_DIR&gt;

         The directory where the test results are going to be placed.  If the specified directory doesn’t exist, it’s created.  The
         default is TestResults in the directory that contains the project file.

         Short form -r available in .NET SDK versions earlier than 7.

       • -r|--runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;

         The target runtime to test for.

         Short form -r available starting in .NET SDK 7.

       • -s|--settings &lt;SETTINGS_FILE&gt;

         The  .runsettings  file to use for running the tests.  The TargetPlatform element (x86|x64) has no effect for dotnet test.
         To run tests that target x86, install the x86 version of .NET Core.  The bitness of the dotnet.exe that is on the path  is
         what will be used for running tests.  For more information, see the following resources:

         • Configure unit tests by using a .runsettings file.

         • Configure a test run (https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-docs/blob/main/docs/configure.md)

       • -t|--list-tests

         List the discovered tests instead of running the tests.

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets  the  verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
         The default is minimal.  For more information, see &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.LoggerVerbosity&gt;.

       • args

         Specifies extra arguments to pass to the adapter.  Use a space to separate multiple arguments.

         The list of possible arguments depends upon the specified behavior:

         • When you specify a project, solution, or a directory, or if you omit this argument, the call is  forwarded  to  msbuild.
           In that case, the available arguments can be found in the dotnet msbuild documentation.

         • When you specify a .dll or an .exe, the call is forwarded to vstest.  In that case, the available arguments can be found
           in the dotnet vstest documentation.

       • RunSettings arguments

       Inline RunSettings are passed as the last arguments on the command line after “–” (note the space after –).  Inline  RunSet‐
       tings are specified as [name]=[value] pairs.  A space is used to separate multiple [name]=[value] pairs.

       Example: dotnet test -- MSTest.DeploymentEnabled=false MSTest.MapInconclusiveToFailed=True

       For  more  information,  see  Passing  RunSettings  arguments  through  command  line  (https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-
       docs/blob/main/docs/RunSettingsArguments.md).

EXAMPLES
       • Run the tests in the project in the current directory:

                dotnet test

       • Run the tests in the test1 project:

                dotnet test ~/projects/test1/test1.csproj

       • Run the tests using test1.dll assembly:

                dotnet test ~/projects/test1/bin/debug/test1.dll

       • Run the tests in the project in the current directory, and generate a test results file in the trx format:

                dotnet test --logger trx

       • Run the tests in the project in the current directory, and generate  a  code  coverage  file  (after  installing  Coverlet
         (https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/blob/master/Documentation/VSTestIntegration.md) collectors integration):

                dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

       • Run the tests in the project in the current directory, and generate a code coverage file (Windows only):

                dotnet test --collect "Code Coverage"

       • Run the tests in the project in the current directory, and log with detailed verbosity to the console:

                dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"

       • Run  the  tests in the project in the current directory, and log with the trx logger to testResults.trx in the TestResults
         folder:

                dotnet test --logger "trx;logfilename=testResults.trx"

         Since the log file name is specified, the same name is used for each target framework in  the  case  of  a  multi-targeted
         project.  The output for each target framework overwrites the output for preceding target frameworks.  The file is created
         in the TestResults folder in the test project folder, because relative paths are relative to that folder.   The  following
         example shows how to produce a separate file for each target framework.

       • Run  the  tests  in  the project in the current directory, and log with the trx logger to files in the TestResults folder,
         with file names that are unique for each target framework:

                dotnet test --logger:"trx;LogFilePrefix=testResults"

       • Run the tests in the project in the current directory, and log with the html logger to testResults.html in the TestResults
         folder:

                dotnet test --logger "html;logfilename=testResults.html"

       • Run the tests in the project in the current directory, and report tests that were in progress when the test host crashed:

                dotnet test --blame

       • Run the tests in the test1 project, providing the -bl (binary log) argument to msbuild:

                dotnet test ~/projects/test1/test1.csproj -bl

       • Run the tests in the test1 project, setting the MSBuild DefineConstants property to DEV:

                dotnet test ~/projects/test1/test1.csproj -p:DefineConstants="DEV"

   Filter option details
       --filter &lt;EXPRESSION&gt;

       &lt;Expression&gt; has the format &lt;property&gt;&lt;operator&gt;&lt;value&gt;[|&amp;&lt;Expression&gt;].

       &lt;property&gt; is an attribute of the Test Case.  The following are the properties supported by popular unit test frameworks:

       Test Framework   Supported properties
       ──────────────────────────────────────
       MSTest
       xUnit
       NUnit

       The &lt;operator&gt; describes the relationship between the property and the value:

       Operator   Function
       ───────────────────────────
          =       Exact match
          !=      Not exact match
          ~       Contains
          !~      Not contains

       &lt;value&gt; is a string.  All the lookups are case insensitive.

       An  expression  without an &lt;operator&gt; is automatically considered as a contains on FullyQualifiedName property (for example,
       dotnet test --filter xyz is same as dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~xyz).

       Expressions can be joined with conditional operators:

       Operator   Function
       ────────────────────
       |          OR

       &amp;          AND

       You can enclose expressions in parenthesis when using conditional operators (for example, (Name~TestMethod1)  |  (Name~Test‐
       Method2)).
