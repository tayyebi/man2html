NAME
       HTML::Tree - build and scan parse-trees of HTML

VERSION
       This document describes version 5.07 of HTML::Tree, released August 31, 2017 as part of HTML-Tree.

SYNOPSIS
           use HTML::TreeBuilder;
           my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gt;new();
           $tree-&gt;parse_file($filename);

               # Then do something with the tree, using HTML::Element
               # methods -- for example:

           $tree-&gt;dump

               # Finally:

           $tree-&gt;delete;

DESCRIPTION
       HTML-Tree is a suite of Perl modules for making parse trees out of HTML source.  It consists of mainly two modules, whose
       documentation you should refer to: HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element.

       HTML::TreeBuilder is the module that builds the parse trees.  (It uses HTML::Parser to do the work of breaking the HTML up
       into tokens.)

       The tree that TreeBuilder builds for you is made up of objects of the class HTML::Element.

       If you find that you do not properly understand the documentation for HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element, it may be because
       you are unfamiliar with tree-shaped data structures, or with object-oriented modules in general. Sean Burke has written some
       articles for The Perl Journal ("www.tpj.com") that seek to provide that background.  The full text of those articles is
       contained in this distribution, as:

       HTML::Tree::AboutObjects
           "User's View of Object-Oriented Modules" from TPJ17.

       HTML::Tree::AboutTrees
           "Trees" from TPJ18

       HTML::Tree::Scanning
           "Scanning HTML" from TPJ19

       Readers already familiar with object-oriented modules and tree-shaped data structures should read just the last article.
       Readers without that background should read the first, then the second, and then the third.

METHODS
       All these methods simply redirect to the corresponding method in HTML::TreeBuilder.  It's more efficient to use
       HTML::TreeBuilder directly, and skip loading HTML::Tree at all.

   new
       Redirects to "new" in HTML::TreeBuilder.

   new_from_file
       Redirects to "new_from_file" in HTML::TreeBuilder.

   new_from_content
       Redirects to "new_from_content" in HTML::TreeBuilder.

   new_from_url
       Redirects to "new_from_url" in HTML::TreeBuilder.

SUPPORT
       You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
