NAME
       Glib::Signal -  Object customization and general purpose notification

DESCRIPTION
       This page describes some functions related to signals in Glib.  Since most things you can do with signals are tied to
       Glib::Object instances, the majority of the signal functions are documented there.

   Thread safety
       Some libraries, most notably GStreamer, sometimes invoke signal handlers from a foreign thread that has no Perl interpreter
       associated with it.  When this happens, we have no choice but to hand the marshalling over to the main loop which in turn
       later wakes up the main thread and lets it handle the request.  We cannot invoke the signal handler from the foreign thread
       since the Perl interpreter may not be used concurrently.

       The downside to this approach is that the foreign thread is blocked until the main thread has finished executing the signal
       handler.  This might lead to deadlocks.  It might help in this case to wrap the crucial parts of the signal handler inside a
       Glib::Idle callback so that the signal handler can return directly.

METHODS
   integer = Glib-&gt;install_exception_handler ($func, $data=undef)
       •   $func (subroutine)

       •   $data (scalar)

       Install a subroutine to be executed when a signal emission traps an exception (a croak or die).  $func should return boolean
       (true if the handler should remain installed) and expect to receive a single scalar.  This scalar will be a private copy of
       $@ which the handler can mangle to its heart's content.

       Returns an identifier that may be used with "remove_exception_handler".

       See "gperl_install_exception_handler()" in Glib::xsapi.

   Glib-&gt;remove_exception_handler ($tag)
       •   $tag (integer)

       Remove the exception handler identified by $tag, as returned by "install_exception_handler".  If $tag cannot be found, this
       does nothing.

       WARNING:  Do not call this function from within an exception handler.  If you want to remove your handler during its
       execution just have it return false.

       See "gperl_remove_exception_handler()" in Glib::xsapi.
