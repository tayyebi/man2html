NAME
       Gtk3 - Perl interface to the 3.x series of the gtk+ toolkit

SYNOPSIS
         use Gtk3 -init;
         my $window = Gtk3::Window-&gt;new ('toplevel');
         my $button = Gtk3::Button-&gt;new ('Quit');
         $button-&gt;signal_connect (clicked =&gt; sub { Gtk3::main_quit });
         $window-&gt;add ($button);
         $window-&gt;show_all;
         Gtk3::main;

ABSTRACT
       Perl bindings to the 3.x series of the gtk+ toolkit.  This module allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish
       and object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to
       original API.

DESCRIPTION
       The "Gtk3" module allows a Perl developer to use the gtk+ graphical user interface library.  Find out more about gtk+ at
       &lt;http://www.gtk.org&gt;.

       The gtk+ reference manual is also a handy companion when writing "Gtk3" programs in Perl:
       &lt;http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/&gt;.  The Perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and the C reference
       documentation should be considered the canonical source.  The principles underlying the mapping from C to Perl are explained
       in the documentation of Glib::Object::Introspection, on which "Gtk3" is based.

       Glib::Object::Introspection also comes with the "perli11ndoc" program which displays the API reference documentation of all
       installed libraries organized in accordance with these principles.

   Wrapped libraries
       "Gtk3" automatically sets up the following correspondence between C libraries and Perl packages:

         Library       | Package
         --------------+----------
         Gtk-3.0       | Gtk3
         Gdk-3.0       | Gtk3::Gdk
         GdkPixbuf-2.0 | Gtk3::Gdk
         GdkPixdata-2.0| Gtk3::Gdk
         Pango-1.0     | Pango

   Import arguments
       When importing "Gtk3", you can pass "-init" as in "use Gtk3 -init;" to have "Gtk3::init" automatically called.  You can also
       pass a version number to require a certain version of "Gtk3".

   Customizations and overrides
       In order to make things more Perlish or to make porting from "Gtk2" to "Gtk3" easier, "Gtk3" customizes the API generated by
       Glib::Object::Introspection in a few spots:

       •   The array ref normally returned by the following functions is flattened into a list:

           Gtk3::ActionGroup::list_actions
           Gtk3::Builder::get_objects
           Gtk3::CellLayout::get_cells
           Gtk3::Container::get_children
           Gtk3::SizeGroup::get_widgets
           Gtk3::TreePath::get_indices
           Gtk3::TreeView::get_columns
           Gtk3::UIManager::get_action_groups
           Gtk3::UIManager::get_toplevels
           Gtk3::Window::list_toplevels
           Gtk3::stock_list_ids
           Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf::get_formats
       •   The following functions normally return a boolean and additional out arguments, where the boolean indicates whether the
           out arguments are valid.  They are altered such that when the boolean is true, only the additional out arguments are
           returned, and when the boolean is false, an empty list is returned.

           Gtk3::TextBuffer::get_selection_bounds
           Gtk3::TreeModel::get_iter
           Gtk3::TreeModel::get_iter_first
           Gtk3::TreeModel::get_iter_from_string
           Gtk3::TreeModel::iter_children
           Gtk3::TreeModel::iter_nth_child
           Gtk3::TreeModel::iter_parent
           Gtk3::TreeModelFilter::convert_child_iter_to_iter
           Gtk3::TreeModelSort::convert_child_iter_to_iter
           Gtk3::TreeSelection::get_selected
           Gtk3::TreeView::get_dest_row_at_pos
           Gtk3::TreeView::get_path_at_pos
           Gtk3::TreeView::get_tooltip_context
           Gtk3::TreeView::get_visible_range
           Gtk3::TreeViewColumn::cell_get_position
           Gtk3::stock_lookup
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_axis
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_button
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_click_count
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_coords
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_keycode
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_keyval
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_scroll_direction
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_scroll_deltas
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_state
           Gtk3::Gdk::Event::get_root_coords
           Gtk3::Gdk::Window::get_origin
       •   Values of type Gtk3::ResponseType are converted to and from nick names if possible, while still allowing raw IDs, in the
           following places:

           - For Gtk3::Dialog and Gtk3::InfoBar: the signal "response" as well as the methods "add_action_widget", "add_button",
           "add_buttons", "response", "set_default_response" and "set_response_sensitive".
           - For Gtk3::Dialog: the methods "get_response_for_widget", "get_widget_for_response", "run" and
           "set_alternative_button_order".
       •   Values of type Gtk3::IconSize are converted to and from nick names if possible, while still allowing raw IDs, in the
           following places:

           - Gtk3::Image: the constructors new_from_stock, new_from_icon_set, new_from_icon_name and new_from_gicon, the getters
           get_stock, get_icon_set, get_icon_name and get_gicon and the setters set_from_stock, set_from_icon_set,
           set_from_icon_name, set_from_gicon.
           - Gtk3::Widget: the method render_icon.
       •   The constants "Gtk3::EVENT_PROPAGATE" and "Gtk3::EVENT_STOP" can be used in handlers for event signals like
           "key-press-event" to indicate whether or not the event should continue propagating through the widget hierarchy.

       •   The records corresponding to the various Gtk3::Gdk::Event types, like "expose" or "key-release", are represented as
           objects blessed into specific Perl packages, like "Gtk3::Gdk::EventExpose" or "Gtk3::Gdk::EventKey", that all inherit
           from "Gtk3::Gdk::Event".  This allows you to seemlessly access type-specific fields as well as common fields, as in
           "$event-&gt;window" or "$event-&gt;keyval".

       •   Gtk3::Gdk::Atom has overloads for the "==" and "!=" operators that check for equality of the underlying atoms.

       •   For backwards compatibility, the functions "Gtk3::get_version_info" and "Gtk3::GET_VERSION_INFO" are provided, and the
           functions "Gtk3::CHECK_VERSION", "Gtk3::check_version", "Gtk3::init", "Gtk3::init_check", "Gtk3::main",
           "Gtk3::main_level" and "Gtk3::main_quit" can be called as class-static or as normal functions: for example,
           "Gtk3-&gt;main_quit" and "Gtk3::main_quit" are both supported.  Additionally, "Gtk3::init" and "Gtk3::init_check"
           automatically handle passing and updating @ARGV as appropriate.

       •   A Perl reimplementation of "Gtk3::show_about_dialog" is provided.

           automatically.

       •   A Perl reimplementation of "Gtk3::Builder::connect_signals" is provided.

       •   The default "new" constructors of Gtk3::Button, Gtk3::CheckButton, Gtk3::ColorButton, Gtk3::FontButton and

       •   "Gtk3::Container::find_child_property" and "Gtk3::Container::list_child_properties" are forwarded to the corresponding
           functions in "Gtk3::ContainerClass".

       •   "Gtk3::Container::get_focus_chain" returns a list of widgets, or an empty list.

       •   "Gtk3::Menu::popup" reroutes to "popup_for_device" for better callback handling.

       •   "Gtk3::Menu::popup_for_device" allows the given menu position func to return only x and y coordinates, defaulting
           "push_in" to FALSE.

       •   The default "new" constructor of Gtk3::MenuItem reroutes to "new_with_mnemonic" if given an extra argument.

       •   A Perl reimplementation of "Gtk3::MessageDialog::new" is provided.

       •   The "length" arguments of "Gtk3::TextBuffer::insert", "insert_at_cursor", "insert_interactive",
           "insert_interactive_at_cursor", "insert_markup" and "set_text" are optional.

       •   Perl reimplementations of "Gtk3::TextBuffer::insert_with_tags" and "insert_with_tags_by_name" are provided which do not
           require a "length" argument.

       •   A Perl reimplementation of "Gtk3::TreeModel::get" is provided.

       •   A redirect is added from "Gtk3::TreeModelFilter::new" to &lt;Gtk3::TreeModel::filter_new&gt; so that Gtk3::TreeModelFilter
           objects can be constructed normally.

       •   Gtk3::TreeModelFilter has a "get" method that calls "Gtk3::TreeModel::get" instead of "Glib::Object::get".

       •   Prior to gtk+ 3.24.14, a redirect is added from "Gtk3::TreeModelSort::new_with_model" to
           &lt;Gtk3::TreeModel::sort_new_with_model&gt; so that Gtk3::TreeModelSort objects can be constructed normally.

       •   Gtk3::TreeModelSort has a "get" method that calls "Gtk3::TreeModel::get" instead of "Glib::Object::get".

       •   "Gtk3::TreePath::new" redirects to "new_from_string" if an additional argument is given.

       •   Perl reimplementations of "Gtk3::TreeViewColumn::set_attributes" and "Gtk3::CellLayout::set_attributes" are provided.

       •   "Gtk3::UIManager::add_ui_from_string" takes no "length" argument.

       •   "Gtk3::VBox::new" uses the defaults homogeneous = FALSE and spacing = 5.

       •   "Gtk3::Widget::add_events" and "Gtk3::Widget::set_events" also accept strings, array references and
           "Gtk3::Gdk::EventMask" objects for the "events" parameter.

       •   "Gtk3::Widget::get_events" returns a "Gtk3::Gdk::EventMask" object that can also be compared to numeric values with "=="
           and "&gt;=".

       •   "Gtk3::Widget::find_style_property" and "Gtk3::Widget::list_style_properties" are forwarded to the corresponding
           functions in "Gtk3::WidgetClass".

       •   A Perl reimplementation of "Gtk3::Widget::style_get" is provided.

       •   "Gtk3::Window::new" uses the default type = 'toplevel'.

       •   A constructor "Gtk3::Gdk::RGBA::new" is provided that can be called as "Gtk3::Gdk::RGBA-&gt;new (r, g, b, a)".

       •   "Gtk3::Gdk::RGBA::parse" can be called as a function returning a new instance ("$rgba = Gtk3::Gdk::RGBA::parse ($spec)")
           or as a method ("$rgba-&gt;parse ($spec)").

       •   "Gtk3::Gdk::Window::new" optionally computes the "attr_mask" automatically from the given "attr".

       •   "Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf::get_pixels" returns a byte string.

       •   "Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf::new_from_data" is reimplemented in terms of "new_from_bytes" (with gdk-pixbuf &gt;= 2.32) or
           "new_from_inline" (with gtk-pixbuf &lt; 2.32) for correct memory management.  No "destroy_fn" and "destroy_fn_data"
           arguments are needed.

       •   "Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf::new_from_inline" does not take a "copy_pixels" argument.  It is always set to TRUE for correct
           memory management.

       •   "Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf::new_from_xpm_data" also accepts a list of XPM lines.

       •   "Gtk3::Gdk::Pixbuf::save", "save_to_buffer" and "save_to_callback" also accept "key =&gt; value" pairs and invoke the
           correct C function as appropriate for the current gdk-pixbuf version.

       •   The "length" arguments of "Pango::Layout::set_text" and "set_markup" are optional.

   Perl compatibility
       As of 5.20.0, perl does not automatically re-check the locale environment for changes.  If a function thus changes the
       locale behind perl's back, problems might arise whenever numbers are formatted, for example when checking versions.  To
       ensure perl's assumption about the locale are up-to-date, the functions "Gtk3::init", "init_check", "init_with_args" and
       "parse_args" are amended to let perl know of any changes.

   Porting from Gtk2 to Gtk3
       The majority of the API has not changed, so as a first approximation you can run "s/Gtk2/Gtk3/" on your application.  A big
       exception to this rule is APIs that were deprecated in gtk+ 2.x -- these were all removed from gtk+ 3.0 and thus from Gtk3.
       The migration guide at &lt;http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/migrating.html&gt; describes what to use instead.  Apart from
       this, here is a list of some other incompatible differences between Gtk2 and Gtk3:

       •   The call syntax for class-static methods is now always "Gtk3::Stock::lookup" instead of "Gtk3::Stock-&gt;lookup".

       •   The %Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms hash is gone; instead of "Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms{XYZ}", use "Gtk3::Gdk::KEY_XYZ".

       •   The Gtk2::Pango compatibility wrapper was not carried over; simply use the namespace "Pango" everywhere.  It gets set up
           automatically when loading Gtk3.

       •   The types Gtk3::Allocation and Gtk3::Gdk::Rectangle are now aliases for Cairo::RectangleInt, and as such they are
           represented as plain hashes with keys 'width', 'height', 'x' and 'y'.

       •   Gtk3::Editable: Callbacks connected to the "insert-text" signal do not have as many options anymore as they had in Gtk2.
           Changes to arguments will not be propagated to the next signal handler, and only the updated position can and must be
           returned.

       •   Gtk3::Menu: In gtk+ &lt; 3.16, the position callback passed to popup() does not receive x and y parameters.

       •   Gtk3::RadioAction: The constructor now follows the C API.

       •   Gtk3::TreeModel: iter_next() is now a method that is modifying the iter directly, instead of returning a new one.
           rows_reordered() and the "rows-reordered" signal are currently unusable.

       •   Gtk3::TreeSelection: get_selected_rows() now returns two values: an array ref containing the selected paths, and the
           model.  get_user_data() is not available currently.

       •   Gtk3::TreeSortable: get_sort_column_id() has an additional boolean return value.

       •   Gtk3::TreeStore, Gtk3::ListStore: reorder() is currently unusable.

       •   Gtk3::Widget: grab_add() and grab_remove() are methods now: "$widget-&gt;grab_add", "$widget-&gt;grab_remove".

       •   Gtk3::Gdk::Atom: The constructor new() is not provided anymore, and the class function intern() must now be called as
           "Gtk3::Gdk::Atom::intern (name, only_if_exists)".

       •   Implementations of Gtk3::TreeModel: Gtk3::TreeIter now has a constructor called new() expecting "key =&gt; value" pairs;
           new_from_arrayref() does not exist anymore.  To access the contents of Gtk3::TreeIter, use stamp(), user_data(),
           user_data2() and user_data3(); to_arrayref() does not exist anymore.  GET_ITER(), ITER_CHILDREN(), ITER_NTH_CHILD() and
           ITER_PARENT() must return an additional boolean value.  ITER_NEXT() must modify the iter and return a boolean rather
           than return a new iter.  GET_VALUE() must return the value wrapped with
           "Glib::Object::Introspection::GValueWrapper-&gt;new".

       •   Implementations of Gtk3::CellLayout: GET_CELLS() now needs to return an array ref instead of a list.

       Note also that Gtk3::CHECK_VERSION will always fail when passed 2.y.z, so if you have any existing version checks in your
       code, you will most likely need to remove them.
