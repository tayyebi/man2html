DESCRIPTION
       Manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Be a little more verbose and show remote url after name. For promisor remotes, also show which filter (blob:none etc.)
           are configured. NOTE: This must be placed between remote and subcommand.

COMMANDS
       With no arguments, shows a list of existing remotes. Several subcommands are available to perform operations on the remotes.

       add
           Add a remote named &lt;name&gt; for the repository at &lt;URL&gt;. The command git fetch &lt;name&gt; can then be used to create and
           update remote-tracking branches &lt;name&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;.

           With -f option, git fetch &lt;name&gt; is run immediately after the remote information is set up.

           With --tags option, git fetch &lt;name&gt; imports every tag from the remote repository.

           With --no-tags option, git fetch &lt;name&gt; does not import tags from the remote repository.

           By default, only tags on fetched branches are imported (see git-fetch(1)).

           With -t &lt;branch&gt; option, instead of the default glob refspec for the remote to track all branches under the
           refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/ namespace, a refspec to track only &lt;branch&gt; is created. You can give more than one -t &lt;branch&gt; to
           track multiple branches without grabbing all branches.

           With -m &lt;master&gt; option, a symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD is set up to point at remote’s &lt;master&gt; branch. See
           also the set-head command.

           When a fetch mirror is created with --mirror=fetch, the refs will not be stored in the refs/remotes/ namespace, but
           rather everything in refs/ on the remote will be directly mirrored into refs/ in the local repository. This option only
           makes sense in bare repositories, because a fetch would overwrite any local commits.

           When a push mirror is created with --mirror=push, then git push will always behave as if --mirror was passed.

       rename
           Rename the remote named &lt;old&gt; to &lt;new&gt;. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are
           updated.

           In case &lt;old&gt; and &lt;new&gt; are the same, and &lt;old&gt; is a file under $GIT_DIR/remotes or $GIT_DIR/branches, the remote is
           converted to the configuration file format.

       remove, rm
           Remove the remote named &lt;name&gt;. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are removed.

       set-head
           Sets or deletes the default branch (i.e. the target of the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD) for the named remote.
           Having a default branch for a remote is not required, but allows the name of the remote to be specified in lieu of a
           specific branch. For example, if the default branch for origin is set to master, then origin may be specified wherever
           you would normally specify origin/master.

           With -d or --delete, the symbolic ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD is deleted.

           With -a or --auto, the remote is queried to determine its HEAD, then the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD is set to
           the same branch. e.g., if the remote HEAD is pointed at next, git remote set-head origin -a will set the symbolic-ref
           refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to refs/remotes/origin/next. This will only work if refs/remotes/origin/next already exists; if
           not it must be fetched first.

           Use &lt;branch&gt; to set the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&lt;name&gt;/HEAD explicitly. e.g., git remote set-head origin master will
           set the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to refs/remotes/origin/master. This will only work if
           refs/remotes/origin/master already exists; if not it must be fetched first.

       set-branches
           Changes the list of branches tracked by the named remote. This can be used to track a subset of the available remote
           branches after the initial setup for a remote.

           The named branches will be interpreted as if specified with the -t option on the git remote add command line.

           With --add, instead of replacing the list of currently tracked branches, adds to that list.

       get-url
           Retrieves the URLs for a remote. Configurations for insteadOf and pushInsteadOf are expanded here. By default, only the
           first URL is listed.

           With --push, push URLs are queried rather than fetch URLs.

           With --all, all URLs for the remote will be listed.

       set-url
           Changes URLs for the remote. Sets first URL for remote &lt;name&gt; that matches regex &lt;oldurl&gt; (first URL if no &lt;oldurl&gt; is
           given) to &lt;newurl&gt;. If &lt;oldurl&gt; doesn’t match any URL, an error occurs and nothing is changed.

           With --push, push URLs are manipulated instead of fetch URLs.

           With --add, instead of changing existing URLs, new URL is added.

           With --delete, instead of changing existing URLs, all URLs matching regex &lt;URL&gt; are deleted for remote &lt;name&gt;. Trying to
           delete all non-push URLs is an error.

           Note that the push URL and the fetch URL, even though they can be set differently, must still refer to the same place.
           What you pushed to the push URL should be what you would see if you immediately fetched from the fetch URL. If you are
           trying to fetch from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another (e.g. your publishing repository), use two
           separate remotes.

       show
           Gives some information about the remote &lt;name&gt;.

           With -n option, the remote heads are not queried first with git ls-remote &lt;name&gt;; cached information is used instead.

       prune
           Deletes stale references associated with &lt;name&gt;. By default, stale remote-tracking branches under &lt;name&gt; are deleted,
           but depending on global configuration and the configuration of the remote we might even prune local tags that haven’t
           been pushed there. Equivalent to git fetch --prune &lt;name&gt;, except that no new references will be fetched.

           See the PRUNING section of git-fetch(1) for what it’ll prune depending on various configuration.

           With --dry-run option, report what branches would be pruned, but do not actually prune them.

       update
           Fetch updates for remotes or remote groups in the repository as defined by remotes.&lt;group&gt;. If neither group nor remote
           is specified on the command line, the configuration parameter remotes.default will be used; if remotes.default is not
           defined, all remotes which do not have the configuration parameter remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipDefaultUpdate set to true will be
           updated. (See git-config(1)).

           With --prune option, run pruning against all the remotes that are updated.

DISCUSSION
       The remote configuration is achieved using the remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch configuration variables. (See git-
       config(1)).

EXIT STATUS
       On success, the exit status is 0.

       When subcommands such as add, rename, and remove can’t find the remote in question, the exit status is 2. When the remote
       already exists, the exit status is 3.

       On any other error, the exit status may be any other non-zero value.

EXAMPLES
       •   Add a new remote, fetch, and check out a branch from it

               $ git remote
               origin
               $ git branch -r
                 origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master
                 origin/master
               $ git remote add staging git://git.kernel.org/.../gregkh/staging.git
               $ git remote
               origin
               staging
               $ git fetch staging
               ...
               From git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging
                * [new branch]      master     -&gt; staging/master
                * [new branch]      staging-linus -&gt; staging/staging-linus
                * [new branch]      staging-next -&gt; staging/staging-next
               $ git branch -r
                 origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master
                 origin/master
                 staging/master
                 staging/staging-linus
                 staging/staging-next
               $ git switch -c staging staging/master
               ...

       •   Imitate git clone but track only selected branches

               $ mkdir project.git
               $ cd project.git
               $ git init
               $ git remote add -f -t master -m master origin git://example.com/git.git/
               $ git merge origin
