NAME
       deb-changes - Debian changes file format

SYNOPSIS
       filename.changes

DESCRIPTION
       Each Debian upload is composed of a .changes control file, which contains a number of fields in deb822(5) format.

       Each field begins with a tag, such as Source or Binary (case insensitive), followed by a colon, and the body of the field
       (case sensitive unless stated otherwise).  Fields are delimited only by field tags.  In other words, field text may be
       multiple lines in length, but the installation tools will generally join lines when processing the body of the field (except
       in case of the multiline fields Description, Changes, Files, Checksums-Sha1 and Checksums-Sha256, see below).

       The control data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII Armored signature, as specified in RFC4880.

FIELDS
       Format: format-version (required)
           The value of this field declares the format version of the file.  The syntax of the field value is a version number with
           a major and minor component.  Backward incompatible changes to the format will bump the major version, and backward
           compatible changes (such as field additions) will bump the minor version.  The current format version is 1.8.

       Date: release-date (required)
           The date the package was built or last edited.  It must be in the same format as the date in a deb-changelog(5) entry.

           The value of this field is usually extracted from the debian/changelog file.

       Source: source-name [(source-version)] (required)
           The name of the source package.  If the source version differs from the binary version, then the source-name will be
           followed by a source-version in parenthesis.  This can happen when the upload is a binary-only non-maintainer upload.

       Binary: binary-package-list (required in context)
           This folded field is a space-separated list of binary packages to upload.  If the upload is source-only, then the field
           is omitted (since dpkg 1.19.3).

       Architecture: arch-list
           Lists the architectures of the files currently being uploaded.  Common architectures are amd64, armel, i386, etc.  Note
           that the all value is meant for packages that are architecture independent.  If the source for the package is also being
           uploaded, the special entry source is also present.  Architecture wildcards must never be present in the list.

       Version: version-string (required)
           Typically, this is the original package's version number in whatever form the program's author uses.  It may also
           include a Debian revision number (for non-native packages).  The exact format and sorting algorithm are described in
           deb-version(7).

       Distribution: distributions (required)
           Lists one or more space-separated distributions where this version should be installed when it is uploaded to the
           archive.

       Urgency: urgency (recommended)
           The urgency of the upload.  The currently known values, in increasing order of urgency, are: low, medium, high, critical
           and emergency.

       Maintainer: fullname-email (required)
           Should be in the format “Joe Bloggs &lt;jbloggs@example.org&gt;”, and is typically the person who created the package, as
           opposed to the author of the software that was packaged.

       Changed-By: fullname-email
           Should be in the format “Joe Bloggs &lt;jbloggs@example.org&gt;”, and is typically the person who prepared the package changes
           for this release.

       Description: (recommended)
        binary-package-name - binary-package-summary
           This multiline field contains a list of binary package names followed by a space, a dash (‘-’) and their possibly
           truncated short descriptions.  If the upload is source-only, then the field is omitted (since dpkg 1.19.3).

       Closes: bug-number-list
           A space-separated list of bug report numbers for bug reports that have been resolved with this upload.  The distribution
           archive software might use this field to automatically close the referred bug numbers in the distribution bug tracking
           system.

       Binary-Only: yes
           This field denotes that the upload is a binary-only non-maintainer build.  It originates from the binary-only=yes
           key/value from the changelog metadata entry.

       Built-For-Profiles: profile-list
           This field specifies a whitespace separated list of build profiles that this upload was built with.

       Changes: (required)
        changelog-entries
           This multiline field contains the concatenated text of all changelog entries that are part of the upload.  To make this
           a valid multiline field empty lines are replaced with a single full stop (‘.’) and all lines are indented by one space
           character.  The exact content depends on the changelog format.

       Files: (required)
        md5sum size section priority filename
           This multiline field contains a list of files with an md5sum, size, section and priority for each one.

           The first line of the field value (the part on the same line as the field name followed by a colon) is always empty.
           The content of the field is expressed as continuation lines, one line per file.  Each line consists of space-separated
           entries describing the file: the md5sum, the file size, the file section, the file priority, and the file name.

           This field lists all files that make up the upload.  The list of files in this field must match the list of files in the
           other related Checksums fields.

       Checksums-Sha1: (required)
       Checksums-Sha256: (required)
        checksum size filename
           These multiline fields contain a list of files with a checksum and size for each one.  These fields have the same syntax
           and differ only in the checksum algorithm used: SHA-1 for Checksums-Sha1 and SHA-256 for Checksums-Sha256.

           The first line of the field value (the part on the same line as the field name followed by a colon) is always empty.
           The content of the field is expressed as continuation lines, one line per file.  Each line consists of space-separated
           entries describing the file: the checksum, the file size, and the file name.

           These fields list all files that make up the upload.  The list of files in these fields must match the list of files in
           the Files field and the other related Checksums fields.

BUGS
       The Files field is inconsistent with the other Checksums fields.  The Changed-By and Maintainer fields have confusing names.
       The Distribution field contains information about what is commonly referred to as a suite.
