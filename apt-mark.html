NAME
       apt-mark - show, set and unset various settings for a package

SYNOPSIS
       apt-mark {-f=filename | {auto | manual} pkg...  | {showauto | showmanual} [pkg...] } | {-v | --version} | {-h | --help}

       apt-mark {hold | unhold | install | remove | purge} pkg...  | {showhold | showinstall | showremove | showpurge} [pkg...]

DESCRIPTION
       apt-mark can be used as a unified front-end to set various settings for a package, such as marking a package as being
       automatically/manually installed or changing dpkg selections such as hold, install, deinstall and purge which are respected
       e.g. by apt-get dselect-upgrade or aptitude.

AUTOMATICALLY AND MANUALLY INSTALLED PACKAGES
       When you request that a package is installed, and as a result other packages are installed to satisfy its dependencies, the
       dependencies are marked as being automatically installed, while the package you installed explicitly is marked as manually
       installed. Once an automatically installed package is no longer depended on by any manually installed package it is
       considered no longer needed and e.g.  apt-get or aptitude will at least suggest removing them.

       auto
           auto is used to mark a package as being automatically installed, which will cause the package to be removed when no more
           manually installed packages depend on this package.

       manual
           manual is used to mark a package as being manually installed, which will prevent the package from being automatically
           removed if no other packages depend on it.

       minimize-manual
           minimize-manual is used to mark (transitive) dependencies of metapackages as automatically installed. This can be used
           after an installation for example, to minimize the number of manually installed packages; or continuously on systems
           managed by system configuration metapackages.

       showauto
           showauto is used to print a list of automatically installed packages with each package on a new line. All automatically
           installed packages will be listed if no package is given. If packages are given only those which are automatically
           installed will be shown.

       showmanual
           showmanual can be used in the same way as showauto except that it will print a list of manually installed packages
           instead.

   Options
       -f=filename, --file=filename
           Read/Write package stats from the filename given with the parameter filename instead of from the default location, which
           is extended_states in the directory defined by the Configuration Item: Dir::State.

PREVENT CHANGES FOR A PACKAGE
       hold
           hold is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the package from being automatically installed, upgraded
           or removed.

       unhold
           unhold is used to cancel a previously set hold on a package to allow all actions again.

       showhold
           showhold is used to print a list of packages on hold in the same way as for the other show commands.

SCHEDULE PACKAGES FOR INSTALL, REMOVE AND PURGE
       Some front-ends like apt-get dselect-upgrade can be used to apply previously scheduled changes to the install state of
       packages. Such changes can be scheduled with the install, remove (also known as deinstall) and purge commands. Packages with
       a specific selection can be displayed with showinstall, showremove and showpurge respectively. More information about these
       so called dpkg selections can be found in dpkg(1).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Show a short usage summary.

       -v, --version
           Show the program version.

       -c, --config-file
           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file and then
           this configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration files are parsed
           specify a file with the APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax information.

       -o, --option
           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o and
           --option can be used multiple times to set different options.

FILES
       /var/lib/apt/extended_states
           Status list of auto-installed packages. Configuration Item: Dir::State::extended_states.
