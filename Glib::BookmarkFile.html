DESCRIPTION
       Glib::BookmarkFile lets you parse, edit or create files containing lists of bookmarks to resources pointed to by URIs, with
       some meta-data bound to them, following the Desktop Bookmark Specification.  The recent files support inside GTK+ uses this
       type of files to store the list of recently used files.

       The syntax of bookmark files is described in detail in the Desktop Bookmarks Specification, here is a quick summary:
       bookmark files use a subclass of the XML Bookmark Exchange Language (XBEL) document format, defining meta-data such as the
       MIME type of the resource pointed by a bookmark, the list of applications that have registered the same URI and the
       visibility of the bookmark.

METHODS
   bookmarkfile = Glib::BookmarkFile-&gt;new
   $bookmark_file-&gt;add_application ($uri, $name, $exec)
       •   $uri (string)

       •   $name (string or undef)

       •   $exec (string or undef)

       Adds the application with $name and $exec to the list of applications that have registered a bookmark for $uri into
       $bookmark_file.

       Every bookmark inside a "Glib::BookmarkFile" must have at least an application registered.  Each application must provide a
       name, a command line useful for launching the bookmark, the number of times the bookmark has been registered by the
       application and the last time the application registered this bookmark.

       If $name is undef, the name of the application will be the same returned by Glib::get_application_name(); if $exec is undef,
       the command line will be a composition of the program name as returned by Glib::get_prgname() and the "%u" modifier, which
       will be expanded to the bookmark's URI.

       This function will automatically take care of updating the registrations count and timestamping in case an application with
       the same $name had already registered a bookmark for $uri inside the bookmark file.  If no bookmark for $uri is found one is
       created.

   $bookmark_file-&gt;add_group ($uri, $group)
       •   $uri (string)

       •   $group (string)

       Adds $group to the list of groups to which the bookmark for $uri belongs to.  If no bookmark for $uri is found one is
       created.

   unix timestamp = $bookmark_file-&gt;get_added ($uri)
       •   $uri (string)

   $bookmark_file-&gt;set_added ($uri, $value)
       •   $uri (string)

       •   $value (unix timestamp)

       Sets the time the bookmark for $uri was added.  If no bookmark for $uri is found one is created.

   ($exec, $count, $stamp) = $bookmark_file-&gt;get_app_info ($uri, $name)
       •   $uri (string)

       •   $name (string)

       Gets the registration information of $name for the bookmark for $uri.  See Glib::BookmarkFile::set_app_info() for more
       information about the returned data.

       May croak with a Glib::Error in $@ on failure.

   $bookmark_file-&gt;set_app_info ($uri, $name, $exec, $count, $stamp)
       •   $uri (string)

       •   $name (string)

       •   $exec (string)

       •   $count (integer)

       •   $stamp (unix timestamp)

       Sets the meta-data of application $name inside the list of applications that have registered a bookmark for $uri inside
       $bookmark_file.

       You should rarely use this method; use Glib::BookmarkFile::add_application() and Glib::BookmarkFile::remove_application()
       instead.

       $name can be any UTF-8 encoded string used to identify an application.  $exec can have one of these two modifiers: "%f",
       which will be expanded as the local file name retrieved from the bookmark's URI; "%u", which will be expanded as the
       bookmark's URI. The expansion is done automatically when retrieving the stored command line using the
       Glib::BookmarkFile::get_app_info() method.  $count is the number of times the application has registered the bookmark; if it
       is &lt; 0, the current registration count will be increased by one, if it is 0, the application with $name will be removed from
       the list of registered applications.  $stamp is the Unix time of the last registration, as returned by time(); if it is -1,
       the current time will be used.

       If you try to remove an application by setting its registration count to zero, and no bookmark for $uri is found, %FALSE is
       returned and an exception is fired.

       May croak with a Glib::Error in $@ on failure.
