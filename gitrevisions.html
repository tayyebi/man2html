NAME
       gitrevisions - Specifying revisions and ranges for Git

SYNOPSIS
       gitrevisions

DESCRIPTION
       Many Git commands take revision parameters as arguments. Depending on the command, they denote a specific commit or, for
       commands which walk the revision graph (such as git-log(1)), all commits which are reachable from that commit. For commands
       that walk the revision graph one can also specify a range of revisions explicitly.

       In addition, some Git commands (such as git-show(1) and git-push(1)) can also take revision parameters which denote other
       objects than commits, e.g. blobs ("files") or trees ("directories of files").

SPECIFYING REVISIONS
       A revision parameter &lt;rev&gt; typically, but not necessarily, names a commit object. It uses what is called an extended SHA-1
       syntax. Here are various ways to spell object names. The ones listed near the end of this list name trees and blobs
       contained in a commit.

           Note
           This document shows the "raw" syntax as seen by git. The shell and other UIs might require additional quoting to protect
           special characters and to avoid word splitting.

       &lt;sha1&gt;, e.g. dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735, dae86e
           The full SHA-1 object name (40-byte hexadecimal string), or a leading substring that is unique within the repository.
           E.g. dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735 and dae86e both name the same commit object if there is no other object in
           your repository whose object name starts with dae86e.

       &lt;describeOutput&gt;, e.g. v1.7.4.2-679-g3bee7fb
           Output from git describe; i.e. a closest tag, optionally followed by a dash and a number of commits, followed by a dash,
           a g, and an abbreviated object name.

       &lt;refname&gt;, e.g. master, heads/master, refs/heads/master
           A symbolic ref name. E.g.  master typically means the commit object referenced by refs/heads/master. If you happen to
           have both heads/master and tags/master, you can explicitly say heads/master to tell Git which one you mean. When
           ambiguous, a &lt;refname&gt; is disambiguated by taking the first match in the following rules:

            1. If $GIT_DIR/&lt;refname&gt; exists, that is what you mean (this is usually useful only for HEAD, FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD,
               MERGE_HEAD and CHERRY_PICK_HEAD);

            2. otherwise, refs/&lt;refname&gt; if it exists;

            3. otherwise, refs/tags/&lt;refname&gt; if it exists;

            4. otherwise, refs/heads/&lt;refname&gt; if it exists;

            5. otherwise, refs/remotes/&lt;refname&gt; if it exists;

            6. otherwise, refs/remotes/&lt;refname&gt;/HEAD if it exists.

               HEAD names the commit on which you based the changes in the working tree.  FETCH_HEAD records the branch which you
               fetched from a remote repository with your last git fetch invocation.  ORIG_HEAD is created by commands that move
               your HEAD in a drastic way, to record the position of the HEAD before their operation, so that you can easily change
               the tip of the branch back to the state before you ran them.  MERGE_HEAD records the commit(s) which you are merging
               into your branch when you run git merge.  CHERRY_PICK_HEAD records the commit which you are cherry-picking when you
               run git cherry-pick.

               Note that any of the refs/* cases above may come either from the $GIT_DIR/refs directory or from the
               $GIT_DIR/packed-refs file. While the ref name encoding is unspecified, UTF-8 is preferred as some output processing
               may assume ref names in UTF-8.

       @
           @ alone is a shortcut for HEAD.

       [&lt;refname&gt;]@{&lt;date&gt;}, e.g. master@{yesterday}, HEAD@{5 minutes ago}
           A ref followed by the suffix @ with a date specification enclosed in a brace pair (e.g.  {yesterday}, {1 month 2 weeks 3
           days 1 hour 1 second ago} or {1979-02-26 18:30:00}) specifies the value of the ref at a prior point in time. This suffix
           may only be used immediately following a ref name and the ref must have an existing log ($GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;). Note that
           this looks up the state of your local ref at a given time; e.g., what was in your local master branch last week. If you
           want to look at commits made during certain times, see --since and --until.

       &lt;refname&gt;@{&lt;n&gt;}, e.g. master@{1}
           A ref followed by the suffix @ with an ordinal specification enclosed in a brace pair (e.g.  {1}, {15}) specifies the
           n-th prior value of that ref. For example master@{1} is the immediate prior value of master while master@{5} is the 5th
           prior value of master. This suffix may only be used immediately following a ref name and the ref must have an existing
           log ($GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;refname&gt;).

       @{&lt;n&gt;}, e.g. @{1}
           You can use the @ construct with an empty ref part to get at a reflog entry of the current branch. For example, if you
           are on branch blabla then @{1} means the same as blabla@{1}.

       @{-&lt;n&gt;}, e.g. @{-1}
           The construct @{-&lt;n&gt;} means the &lt;n&gt;th branch/commit checked out before the current one.

       [&lt;branchname&gt;]@{upstream}, e.g. master@{upstream}, @{u}
           A branch B may be set up to build on top of a branch X (configured with branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge) at a remote R (configured
           with the branch X taken from remote R, typically found at refs/remotes/R/X.

       [&lt;branchname&gt;]@{push}, e.g. master@{push}, @{push}
           The suffix @{push} reports the branch "where we would push to" if git push were run while branchname was checked out (or
           the current HEAD if no branchname is specified). Like for @{upstream}, we report the remote-tracking branch that
           corresponds to that branch at the remote.

           Here’s an example to make it more clear:

               $ git config push.default current
               $ git config remote.pushdefault myfork
               $ git switch -c mybranch origin/master

               $ git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{upstream}
               refs/remotes/origin/master

               $ git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{push}
               refs/remotes/myfork/mybranch

           Note in the example that we set up a triangular workflow, where we pull from one location and push to another. In a
           non-triangular workflow, @{push} is the same as @{upstream}, and there is no need for it.

           This suffix is also accepted when spelled in uppercase, and means the same thing no matter the case.

       &lt;rev&gt;^[&lt;n&gt;], e.g. HEAD^, v1.5.1^0
           A suffix ^ to a revision parameter means the first parent of that commit object.  ^&lt;n&gt; means the &lt;n&gt;th parent (i.e.
           &lt;rev&gt;^ is equivalent to &lt;rev&gt;^1). As a special rule, &lt;rev&gt;^0 means the commit itself and is used when &lt;rev&gt; is the
           object name of a tag object that refers to a commit object.

       &lt;rev&gt;~[&lt;n&gt;], e.g. HEAD~, master~3
           A suffix ~ to a revision parameter means the first parent of that commit object. A suffix ~&lt;n&gt; to a revision parameter
           means the commit object that is the &lt;n&gt;th generation ancestor of the named commit object, following only the first
           parents. I.e.  &lt;rev&gt;~3 is equivalent to &lt;rev&gt;^^^ which is equivalent to &lt;rev&gt;^1^1^1. See below for an illustration of
           the usage of this form.

       &lt;rev&gt;^{&lt;type&gt;}, e.g. v0.99.8^{commit}
           A suffix ^ followed by an object type name enclosed in brace pair means dereference the object at &lt;rev&gt; recursively
           until an object of type &lt;type&gt; is found or the object cannot be dereferenced anymore (in which case, barf). For example,
           if &lt;rev&gt; is a commit-ish, &lt;rev&gt;^{commit} describes the corresponding commit object. Similarly, if &lt;rev&gt; is a tree-ish,
           &lt;rev&gt;^{tree} describes the corresponding tree object.  &lt;rev&gt;^0 is a short-hand for &lt;rev&gt;^{commit}.

           &lt;rev&gt;^{object} can be used to make sure &lt;rev&gt; names an object that exists, without requiring &lt;rev&gt; to be a tag, and
           without dereferencing &lt;rev&gt;; because a tag is already an object, it does not have to be dereferenced even once to get to
           an object.

           &lt;rev&gt;^{tag} can be used to ensure that &lt;rev&gt; identifies an existing tag object.

       &lt;rev&gt;^{}, e.g. v0.99.8^{}
           A suffix ^ followed by an empty brace pair means the object could be a tag, and dereference the tag recursively until a
           non-tag object is found.

       &lt;rev&gt;^{/&lt;text&gt;}, e.g. HEAD^{/fix nasty bug}
           A suffix ^ to a revision parameter, followed by a brace pair that contains a text led by a slash, is the same as the
           :/fix nasty bug syntax below except that it returns the youngest matching commit which is reachable from the &lt;rev&gt;
           before ^.

       :/&lt;text&gt;, e.g. :/fix nasty bug
           A colon, followed by a slash, followed by a text, names a commit whose commit message matches the specified regular
           expression. This name returns the youngest matching commit which is reachable from any ref, including HEAD. The regular
           expression can match any part of the commit message. To match messages starting with a string, one can use e.g.  :/^foo.
           The special sequence :/!  is reserved for modifiers to what is matched.  :/!-foo performs a negative match, while
           :/!!foo matches a literal !  character, followed by foo. Any other sequence beginning with :/!  is reserved for now.
           Depending on the given text, the shell’s word splitting rules might require additional quoting.

       &lt;rev&gt;:&lt;path&gt;, e.g. HEAD:README, master:./README
           A suffix : followed by a path names the blob or tree at the given path in the tree-ish object named by the part before
           the colon. A path starting with ./ or ../ is relative to the current working directory. The given path will be converted
           to be relative to the working tree’s root directory. This is most useful to address a blob or tree from a commit or tree
           that has the same tree structure as the working tree.

       :[&lt;n&gt;:]&lt;path&gt;, e.g. :0:README, :README
           A colon, optionally followed by a stage number (0 to 3) and a colon, followed by a path, names a blob object in the
           index at the given path. A missing stage number (and the colon that follows it) names a stage 0 entry. During a merge,
           stage 1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is the target branch’s version (typically the current branch), and stage 3 is
           the version from the branch which is being merged.

       Here is an illustration, by Jon Loeliger. Both commit nodes B and C are parents of commit node A. Parent commits are ordered
       left-to-right.

           G   H   I   J
            \ /     \ /
             D   E   F
              \  |  / \
               \ | /   |
                \|/    |
                 B     C
                  \   /
                   \ /
                    A

           A =      = A^0
           B = A^   = A^1     = A~1
           C =      = A^2
           D = A^^  = A^1^1   = A~2
           E = B^2  = A^^2
           F = B^3  = A^^3
           G = A^^^ = A^1^1^1 = A~3
           H = D^2  = B^^2    = A^^^2  = A~2^2
           I = F^   = B^3^    = A^^3^
           J = F^2  = B^3^2   = A^^3^2

SPECIFYING RANGES
       History traversing commands such as git log operate on a set of commits, not just a single commit.

       For these commands, specifying a single revision, using the notation described in the previous section, means the set of
       commits reachable from the given commit.

       Specifying several revisions means the set of commits reachable from any of the given commits.

       A commit’s reachable set is the commit itself and the commits in its ancestry chain.

       There are several notations to specify a set of connected commits (called a "revision range"), illustrated below.

   Commit Exclusions
       ^&lt;rev&gt; (caret) Notation
           To exclude commits reachable from a commit, a prefix ^ notation is used. E.g.  ^r1 r2 means commits reachable from r2
           but exclude the ones reachable from r1 (i.e.  r1 and its ancestors).

   Dotted Range Notations
       The .. (two-dot) Range Notation
           The ^r1 r2 set operation appears so often that there is a shorthand for it. When you have two commits r1 and r2 (named
           according to the syntax explained in SPECIFYING REVISIONS above), you can ask for commits that are reachable from r2
           excluding those that are reachable from r1 by ^r1 r2 and it can be written as r1..r2.

       The ... (three-dot) Symmetric Difference Notation
           A similar notation r1...r2 is called symmetric difference of r1 and r2 and is defined as r1 r2 --not $(git merge-base
           --all r1 r2). It is the set of commits that are reachable from either one of r1 (left side) or r2 (right side) but not
           from both.

       In these two shorthand notations, you can omit one end and let it default to HEAD. For example, origin.. is a shorthand for
       origin..HEAD and asks "What did I do since I forked from the origin branch?" Similarly, ..origin is a shorthand for
       HEAD..origin and asks "What did the origin do since I forked from them?" Note that .. would mean HEAD..HEAD which is an
       empty range that is both reachable and unreachable from HEAD.

       Commands that are specifically designed to take two distinct ranges (e.g. "git range-diff R1 R2" to compare two ranges) do
       exist, but they are exceptions. Unless otherwise noted, all "git" commands that operate on a set of commits work on a single
       revision range. In other words, writing two "two-dot range notation" next to each other, e.g.

           $ git log A..B C..D

       does not specify two revision ranges for most commands. Instead it will name a single connected set of commits, i.e. those
       that are reachable from either B or D but are reachable from neither A or C. In a linear history like this:

           ---A---B---o---o---C---D

       because A and B are reachable from C, the revision range specified by these two dotted ranges is a single commit D.

   Other &lt;rev&gt;^ Parent Shorthand Notations
       Three other shorthands exist, particularly useful for merge commits, for naming a set that is formed by a commit and its
       parent commits.

       The r1^@ notation means all parents of r1.

       The r1^! notation includes commit r1 but excludes all of its parents. By itself, this notation denotes the single commit r1.

       The &lt;rev&gt;^-[&lt;n&gt;] notation includes &lt;rev&gt; but excludes the &lt;n&gt;th parent (i.e. a shorthand for &lt;rev&gt;^&lt;n&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;), with &lt;n&gt; = 1
       if not given. This is typically useful for merge commits where you can just pass &lt;commit&gt;^- to get all the commits in the
       branch that was merged in merge commit &lt;commit&gt; (including &lt;commit&gt; itself).

       While &lt;rev&gt;^&lt;n&gt; was about specifying a single commit parent, these three notations also consider its parents. For example
       you can say HEAD^2^@, however you cannot say HEAD^@^2.

REVISION RANGE SUMMARY
       &lt;rev&gt;
           Include commits that are reachable from &lt;rev&gt; (i.e. &lt;rev&gt; and its ancestors).

       ^&lt;rev&gt;
           Exclude commits that are reachable from &lt;rev&gt; (i.e. &lt;rev&gt; and its ancestors).

       &lt;rev1&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;
           Include commits that are reachable from &lt;rev2&gt; but exclude those that are reachable from &lt;rev1&gt;. When either &lt;rev1&gt; or
           &lt;rev2&gt; is omitted, it defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;
           Include commits that are reachable from either &lt;rev1&gt; or &lt;rev2&gt; but exclude those that are reachable from both. When
           either &lt;rev1&gt; or &lt;rev2&gt; is omitted, it defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;rev&gt;^@, e.g. HEAD^@
           A suffix ^ followed by an at sign is the same as listing all parents of &lt;rev&gt; (meaning, include anything reachable from
           its parents, but not the commit itself).

       &lt;rev&gt;^!, e.g. HEAD^!
           A suffix ^ followed by an exclamation mark is the same as giving commit &lt;rev&gt; and all its parents prefixed with ^ to
           exclude them (and their ancestors).

       &lt;rev&gt;^-&lt;n&gt;, e.g. HEAD^-, HEAD^-2
           Equivalent to &lt;rev&gt;^&lt;n&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;, with &lt;n&gt; = 1 if not given.

       Here are a handful of examples using the Loeliger illustration above, with each step in the notation’s expansion and
       selection carefully spelt out:

              Args   Expanded arguments    Selected commits
              D                            G H D
              D F                          G H I J D F
              ^G D                         H D
              ^D B                         E I J F B
              ^D B C                       E I J F B C
              C                            I J F C
              B..C   = ^B C                C
              B...C  = B ^F C              G H D E B C
              B^-    = B^..B
                     = ^B^1 B              E I J F B
              C^@    = C^1
                     = F                   I J F
              B^@    = B^1 B^2 B^3
                     = D E F               D G H E F I J
              C^!    = C ^C^@
                     = C ^C^1
                     = C ^F                C
              B^!    = B ^B^@
                     = B ^B^1 ^B^2 ^B^3
                     = B ^D ^E ^F          B
              F^! D  = F ^I ^J D           G H D F
