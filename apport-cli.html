<pre>apport-cli(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                         apport-cli(1)

NAME
       apport-cli, apport-gtk, apport-kde - Apport user interfaces for reporting problems

SYNOPSIS
       apport-cli

       apport-cli [ --save file ] symptom | pid | package | program path | .apport/.crash file

       apport-cli -f

       apport-cli -f -p package -P pid

       apport-cli -u report-number

       Same options/arguments for apport-gtk and apport-kde.

DESCRIPTION
       apport  automatically  collects  data from crashed processes and compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This is a command
       line frontend for reporting those crashes to the developers. It can also be used to report bugs about  packages  or  running
       processes.

       If symptom scripts are available, it can also be given the name of a symptom, or be called with just -f to display a list of
       known symptoms.

       When being called without any options, it processes the pending crash reports and offers to report them one by one. You  can
       also display the entire report to see what is sent to the software developers.

       When  being  called with exactly one argument and no option, apport-cli uses some heuristics to find out "what you mean" and
       reports a bug against the given symptom name, package name, program path, or PID. If the argument is  a  .crash  or  .apport
       file, it uploads the stored problem report to the bug tracking system.

       For  desktop  systems with a graphical user interface, you should consider installing the GTK or KDE user interface (apport-
       gtk or apport-kde). They accept the very same options and arguments.  apport-cli is mainly intended to be used on servers.

OPTIONS
       -f, --file-bug
              Report a (non-crash) problem. If neither --package, --symptom, or --pid are specified, then it  displays  a  list  of
              available symptoms. If none are available, it aborts with an error.

              This  will  automatically  attach information about your operating system and the package version etc. to the bug re‐
              port, so that the developers have some important context.

       -s symptom, --symptom=symptom
              When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the symptom to report the problem about.

       -p package, --package=package
              When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the package to report the problem against.

       -P pid, --pid=pid
              When being used in --file-bug mode, specify the PID (process ID) of a running program to report the problem  against.
              This can be determined with e. g.  ps -ux.

       -c report, --crash-file=report
              Upload a previously processed stored report in an arbitrary file location.  This is useful for copying a crash report
              to a machine with internet connection and reporting it from there. Files must end in .crash or .apport.

       -u report-number, --update-report report-number
              Run apport information collection on an already existing problem report. The affected package is taken from  the  re‐
              port  by  default,  but  you can explicitly specify one with --package to collect information for a different package
              (this is useful if the report is assigned to the wrong package).

       --save filename
              In --file-bug mode, save the collected information into a file instead of reporting it. This file  can  then  be  re‐
              ported with --crash-file later on.

       -w, --window
              Point  and  click  at the application window against which you wish to report the bug. Apport will automatically find
              the package name and generate a report for you. This option can be specially useful in situations  when  you  do  not
              know  the  name of the package, or if the application window has stopped responding and you cannot report the problem
              from the "Help" menu of the application.

              This option is not supported on Wayland. Users running Wayland should use another option such as -P  to  specify  the
              application.

ENVIRONMENT
       APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES
              Apport refuses to create bug reports if the package or any dependency is not current. If this environment variable is
              set, this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the situation before filing a bug report can define this
              in their ~/.bashrc or temporarily when calling the apport frontend (-cli, -gtk, or -kde).

FILES
       /usr/share/apport/symptoms/*.py
              Symptom scripts. These ask a set of interactive questions to determine the package which is responsible for a partic‐
              ular problem. (For some problems like sound or storage device related bugs there are many places where things can  go
              wrong, and it's not immediately obvious for a bug reporter where the problem is.)
