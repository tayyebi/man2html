NAME
       git-ls-files - Show information about files in the index and the working tree

SYNOPSIS
       git ls-files [-z] [-t] [-v] [-f]
                       [-c|--cached] [-d|--deleted] [-o|--others] [-i|--ignored]
                       [-s|--stage] [-u|--unmerged] [-k|--killed] [-m|--modified]
                       [--directory [--no-empty-directory]] [--eol]
                       [--deduplicate]
                       [-x &lt;pattern&gt;|--exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;]
                       [-X &lt;file&gt;|--exclude-from=&lt;file&gt;]
                       [--exclude-per-directory=&lt;file&gt;]
                       [--exclude-standard]
                       [--error-unmatch] [--with-tree=&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
                       [--full-name] [--recurse-submodules]
                       [--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]] [--format=&lt;format&gt;] [--] [&lt;file&gt;...]

DESCRIPTION
       This merges the file listing in the index with the actual working directory list, and shows different combinations of the
       two.

       One or more of the options below may be used to determine the files shown:

OPTIONS
       -c, --cached
           Show cached files in the output (default)

       -d, --deleted
           Show deleted files in the output

       -m, --modified
           Show modified files in the output

       -o, --others
           Show other (i.e. untracked) files in the output

       -i, --ignored
           Show only ignored files in the output. When showing files in the index, print only those matched by an exclude pattern.
           When showing "other" files, show only those matched by an exclude pattern. Standard ignore rules are not automatically
           activated, therefore at least one of the --exclude* options is required.

       -s, --stage
           Show staged contents' mode bits, object name and stage number in the output.

       --directory
           If a whole directory is classified as "other", show just its name (with a trailing slash) and not its whole contents.

       --no-empty-directory
           Do not list empty directories. Has no effect without --directory.

       -u, --unmerged
           Show unmerged files in the output (forces --stage)

       -k, --killed
           Show files on the filesystem that need to be removed due to file/directory conflicts for checkout-index to succeed.

       -z
           \0 line termination on output and do not quote filenames. See OUTPUT below for more information.

       --deduplicate
           When only filenames are shown, suppress duplicates that may come from having multiple stages during a merge, or giving
           --deleted and --modified option at the same time. When any of the -t, --unmerged, or --stage option is in use, this
           option has no effect.

       -x &lt;pattern&gt;, --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Skip untracked files matching pattern. Note that pattern is a shell wildcard pattern. See EXCLUDE PATTERNS below for
           more information.

       -X &lt;file&gt;, --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt;
           Read exclude patterns from &lt;file&gt;; 1 per line.

       --exclude-per-directory=&lt;file&gt;
           Read additional exclude patterns that apply only to the directory and its subdirectories in &lt;file&gt;.

       --exclude-standard
           Add the standard Git exclusions: .git/info/exclude, .gitignore in each directory, and the userâ€™s global exclusion file.

       --error-unmatch
           If any &lt;file&gt; does not appear in the index, treat this as an error (return 1).

       --with-tree=&lt;tree-ish&gt;
           When using --error-unmatch to expand the user supplied &lt;file&gt; (i.e. path pattern) arguments to paths, pretend that paths
           which were removed in the index since the named &lt;tree-ish&gt; are still present. Using this option with -s or -u options
           does not make any sense.

       -t
           This feature is semi-deprecated. For scripting purpose, git-status(1) --porcelain and git-diff-files(1) --name-status
           are almost always superior alternatives, and users should look at git-status(1) --short or git-diff(1) --name-status for
           more user-friendly alternatives.

           This option identifies the file status with the following tags (followed by a space) at the start of each line:

           H
               cached

           S
               skip-worktree

           M
               unmerged

           R
               removed/deleted

           C
               modified/changed

           K
               to be killed

           ?
               other

       -v
           Similar to -t, but use lowercase letters for files that are marked as assume unchanged (see git-update-index(1)).

       -f
           Similar to -t, but use lowercase letters for files that are marked as fsmonitor valid (see git-update-index(1)).

       --full-name
           When run from a subdirectory, the command usually outputs paths relative to the current directory. This option forces
           paths to be output relative to the project top directory.

       --recurse-submodules
           Recursively calls ls-files on each active submodule in the repository. Currently there is only support for the --cached
           and --stage modes.

       --abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object lines, show the shortest prefix that is at least &lt;n&gt; hexdigits
           long that uniquely refers the object. Non default number of digits can be specified with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.

       --debug
           After each line that describes a file, add more data about its cache entry. This is intended to show as much information
           as possible for manual inspection; the exact format may change at any time.

       --eol
           Show &lt;eolinfo&gt; and &lt;eolattr&gt; of files. &lt;eolinfo&gt; is the file content identification used by Git when the "text"
           attribute is "auto" (or not set and core.autocrlf is not false). &lt;eolinfo&gt; is either "-text", "none", "lf", "crlf",
           "mixed" or "".

           "" means the file is not a regular file, it is not in the index or not accessible in the working tree.

           &lt;eolattr&gt; is the attribute that is used when checking out or committing, it is either "", "-text", "text", "text=auto",
           "text eol=lf", "text eol=crlf". Since Git 2.10 "text=auto eol=lf" and "text=auto eol=crlf" are supported.

           Both the &lt;eolinfo&gt; in the index ("i/&lt;eolinfo&gt;") and in the working tree ("w/&lt;eolinfo&gt;") are shown for regular files,
           followed by the ("attr/&lt;eolattr&gt;").

       --sparse
           If the index is sparse, show the sparse directories without expanding to the contained files. Sparse directories will be
           shown with a trailing slash, such as "x/" for a sparse directory "x".

       --format=&lt;format&gt;
           A string that interpolates %(fieldname) from the result being shown. It also interpolates %% to %, and %xx where xx are
           hex digits interpolates to character with hex code xx; for example %00 interpolates to \0 (NUL), %09 to \t (TAB) and %0a
           to \n (LF). --format cannot be combined with -s, -o, -k, -t, --resolve-undo and --eol.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       &lt;file&gt;
           Files to show. If no files are given all files which match the other specified criteria are shown.

OUTPUT
       git ls-files just outputs the filenames unless --stage is specified in which case it outputs:

           [&lt;tag&gt; ]&lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;stage&gt; &lt;file&gt;

       git ls-files --eol will show i/&lt;eolinfo&gt;&lt;SPACES&gt;w/&lt;eolinfo&gt;&lt;SPACES&gt;attr/&lt;eolattr&gt;&lt;SPACE*&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;file&gt;

       git ls-files --unmerged and git ls-files --stage can be used to examine detailed information on unmerged paths.

       For an unmerged path, instead of recording a single mode/SHA-1 pair, the index records up to three such pairs; one from tree
       O in stage 1, A in stage 2, and B in stage 3. This information can be used by the user (or the porcelain) to see what should
       eventually be recorded at the path. (see git-read-tree(1) for more information on state)

       Without the -z option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the configuration variable
       core.quotePath (see git-config(1)). Using -z the filename is output verbatim and the line is terminated by a NUL byte.

       It is possible to print in a custom format by using the --format option, which is able to interpolate different fields using
       a %(fieldname) notation. For example, if you only care about the "objectname" and "path" fields, you can execute with a
       specific "--format" like

           git ls-files --format='%(objectname) %(path)'

FIELD NAMES
       The way each path is shown can be customized by using the --format=&lt;format&gt; option, where the %(fieldname) in the &lt;format&gt;
       string for various aspects of the index entry are interpolated. The following "fieldname" are understood:

       objectmode
           The mode of the file which is recorded in the index.

       objectname
           The name of the file which is recorded in the index.

       stage
           The stage of the file which is recorded in the index.

       eolinfo:index, eolinfo:worktree
           The &lt;eolinfo&gt; (see the description of the --eol option) of the contents in the index or in the worktree for the path.

       eolattr
           The &lt;eolattr&gt; (see the description of the --eol option) that applies to the path.

       path
           The pathname of the file which is recorded in the index.

EXCLUDE PATTERNS
       git ls-files can use a list of "exclude patterns" when traversing the directory tree and finding files to show when the
       flags --others or --ignored are specified. gitignore(5) specifies the format of exclude patterns.

       These exclude patterns come from these places, in order:

        1. The command-line flag --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt; specifies a single pattern. Patterns are ordered in the same order they appear
           in the command line.

        2. The command-line flag --exclude-from=&lt;file&gt; specifies a file containing a list of patterns. Patterns are ordered in the
           same order they appear in the file.

        3. The command-line flag --exclude-per-directory=&lt;name&gt; specifies a name of the file in each directory git ls-files
           examines, normally .gitignore. Files in deeper directories take precedence. Patterns are ordered in the same order they
           appear in the files.

       A pattern specified on the command line with --exclude or read from the file specified with --exclude-from is relative to
       the top of the directory tree. A pattern read from a file specified by --exclude-per-directory is relative to the directory
       that the pattern file appears in.
