<pre>gai.conf(5)                                             File Formats Manual                                             gai.conf(5)

NAME
       gai.conf - getaddrinfo(3) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       A  call to getaddrinfo(3) might return multiple answers.  According to RFC 3484 these answers must be sorted so that the an‐
       swer with the highest success rate is first in the list.  The RFC provides an algorithm for the sorting.  The  static  rules
       are  not  always adequate, though.  For this reason, the RFC also requires that system administrators should have the possi‐
       bility to dynamically change the sorting.  For the glibc implementation, this can be achieved with the /etc/gai.conf file.

       Each line in the configuration file consists of a keyword and its parameters.  White spaces in any place are ignored.  Lines
       starting with '#' are comments and are ignored.

       The keywords currently recognized are:

       label netmask precedence
              The  value  is added to the label table used in the RFC 3484 sorting.  If any label definition is present in the con‐
              figuration file, the default table is not used.  All the label definitions of the default table which are to be main‐
              tained have to be duplicated.  Following the keyword, the line has to contain a network mask and a precedence value.

       precedence netmask precedence
              This  keyword  is  similar to label, but instead the value is added to the precedence table as specified in RFC 3484.
              Once again, the presence of a single precedence line in the configuration file causes the default  table  to  not  be
              used.

       reload &lt;yes|no&gt;
              This keyword controls whether a process checks whether the configuration file has been changed since the last time it
              was read.  If the value is "yes", the file is reread.  This might cause problems in multithreaded applications and is
              generally a bad idea.  The default is "no".

       scopev4 mask value
              Add another rule to the RFC 3484 scope table for IPv4 address.  By default, the scope IDs described in section 3.2 in
              RFC 3438 are used.  Changing these defaults should hardly ever be necessary.

FILES
       /etc/gai.conf

VERSIONS
       The gai.conf file is supported since glibc 2.5.

EXAMPLES
       The default table according to RFC 3484 would be specified with the following configuration file:

           label  ::1/128       0
           label  ::/0          1
           label  2002::/16     2
           label ::/96          3
           label ::ffff:0:0/96  4
           precedence  ::1/128       50
           precedence  ::/0          40
           precedence  2002::/16     30
           precedence ::/96          20
           precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10
