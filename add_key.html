<pre>add_key(2)                                              System Calls Manual                                              add_key(2)

NAME
       add_key - add a key to the kernel's key management facility

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;keyutils.h&gt;

       key_serial_t add_key(const char *type, const char *description,
                            const void payload[.plen], size_t plen,
                            key_serial_t keyring);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       add_key()  creates  or updates a key of the given type and description, instantiates it with the payload of length plen, at‐
       taches it to the nominated keyring, and returns the key's serial number.

       The key may be rejected if the provided data is in the wrong format or it is invalid in some other way.

       If the destination keyring already contains a key that matches the specified type and description, then,  if  the  key  type
       supports  it,  that key will be updated rather than a new key being created; if not, a new key (with a different ID) will be
       created and it will displace the link to the extant key from the keyring.

       The destination keyring serial number may be that of a valid keyring for which the caller has  write  permission.   Alterna‐
       tively, it may be one of the following special keyring IDs:

       KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's thread-specific keyring (thread-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring (process-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring (session-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring (user-keyring(7)).

       KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring (user-session-keyring(7)).

   Key types
       The  key  type  is  a  string  that specifies the key's type.  Internally, the kernel defines a number of key types that are
       available in the core key management code.  Among the types that are available for user-space use and can  be  specified  as
       the type argument to add_key() are the following:

       "keyring"
              Keyrings  are  special key types that may contain links to sequences of other keys of any type.  If this interface is
              used to create a keyring, then payload should be NULL and plen should be zero.

       "user" This is a general purpose key type whose payload may be read and updated by user-space applications.  The key is kept
              entirely within kernel memory.  The payload for keys of this type is a blob of arbitrary data of up to 32,767 bytes.

       "logon" (since Linux 3.3)
              This  key type is essentially the same as "user", but it does not permit the key to read.  This is suitable for stor‐
              ing payloads that you do not want to be readable from user space.

       This key type vets the description to ensure that it is qualified by a "service" prefix, by checking to ensure that the  de‐
       scription contains a ':' that is preceded by other characters.

       "big_key" (since Linux 3.13)
              This  key type is similar to "user", but may hold a payload of up to 1 MiB.  If the key payload is large enough, then
              it may be stored encrypted in tmpfs (which can be swapped out) rather than kernel memory.

       For further details on these key types, see keyrings(7).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, add_key() returns the serial number of the key it created or updated.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set
       to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The keyring wasn't available for modification by the user.

       EDQUOT The key quota for this user would be exceeded by creating this key or linking it to the keyring.

       EFAULT One or more of type, description, and payload points outside process's accessible address space.

       EINVAL The  size of the string (including the terminating null byte) specified in type or description exceeded the limit (32
              bytes and 4096 bytes respectively).

       EINVAL The payload data was invalid.

       EINVAL type was "logon" and the description was not qualified with a prefix string of the form "service:".

       EKEYEXPIRED
              The keyring has expired.

       EKEYREVOKED
              The keyring has been revoked.

       ENOKEY The keyring doesn't exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory to create a key.

       EPERM  The type started with a period ('.').  Key types that begin with a period are reserved to the implementation.

       EPERM  type was "keyring" and the description started with a period ('.').  Keyrings with descriptions  (names)  that  begin
              with a period are reserved to the implementation.

VERSIONS
       This system call first appeared in Linux 2.6.10.

STANDARDS
       This system call is a nonstandard Linux extension.

NOTES
       glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call.  A wrapper is provided in the libkeyutils library.  (The accompanying
       package provides the &lt;keyutils.h&gt; header file.)  When employing the wrapper in that library, link with -lkeyutils.

EXAMPLES
       The program below creates a key with the type, description, and payload specified in its command-line arguments,  and  links
       that key into the session keyring.  The following shell session demonstrates the use of the program:

           $ ./a.out user mykey "Some payload"
           Key ID is 64a4dca
           $ grep '64a4dca' /proc/keys
           064a4dca I--Q---    1 perm 3f010000  1000  1000 user    mykey: 12
