<pre>ARPD(8)                                               System Manager's Manual                                               ARPD(8)

NAME
       arpd - userspace arp daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       Usage:  arpd [ -lkh? ] [ -a N ] [ -b dbase ] [ -B number ] [ -f file ] [-p interval ] [ -n time ] [ -R rate ] [ &lt;INTERFACES&gt;
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       The arpd daemon collects gratuitous ARP information, saving it on local disk and feeding it to the kernel on demand to avoid
       redundant broadcasting due to limited size of the kernel ARP cache.

OPTIONS
       -h -?  Print help

       -l     Dump  the arpd database to stdout and exit. The output consists of three columns: the interface index, the IP address
              of the interface, and the MAC address of the interface. Negative entries for dead hosts are also shown, in this  case
              the  MAC  address  is replaced by the word FAILED followed by a colon and the most recent time when the fact that the
              host is dead was proven.

       -f &lt;FILE&gt;
              Read and load an arpd database from FILE in a text format similar to that dumped by option -l. Exit after load,  pos‐
              sibly listing resulting database, if option -l is also given. If FILE is -, stdin is read to get the ARP table.

       -b &lt;DATABASE&gt;
              the location of the database file. The default location is /var/lib/arpd/arpd.db

       -a &lt;NUMBER&gt;
              With  this option, arpd not only passively listens for ARP packets on the interface, but also sends broadcast queries
              itself. NUMBER is the number of such queries to make before a destination is considered dead. When arpd is started as
              kernel  helper (i.e. with app_solicit enabled in sysctl or even with option -k) without this option and still did not
              learn enough information, you can observe 1 second gaps in service. Not fatal, but not good.

       -k     Suppress sending broadcast queries by the kernel. This option only makes sense together with option -a.

       -n &lt;TIME&gt;
              Specifies the timeout of the negative cache. When resolution fails, arpd suppresses further attempts to  resolve  for
              this  period. This option only makes sense together with option '-k'. This timeout should not be too much longer than
              the boot time of a typical host not supporting gratuitous ARP. Default value is 60 seconds.

       -p &lt;TIME&gt;
              The time to wait in seconds between polling attempts to the kernel ARP table. TIME may be a  floating  point  number.
              The default value is 30.

       -R &lt;RATE&gt;
              Maximal steady rate of broadcasts sent by arpd in packets per second. Default value is 1.

       -B &lt;NUMBER&gt;
              The  number of broadcasts sent by arpd back to back. Default value is 3. Together with the -R option, this option en‐
              sures that the number of ARP queries that are broadcast does not exceed B+R*T over any interval of time T.

       &lt;INTERFACES&gt; is a list of names of networking interfaces to watch. If no interfaces are given, arpd monitors all the  inter‐
       faces.  In  this  case  arpd  does not adjust sysctl parameters, it is assumed that the user does this himself after arpd is
       started.

SIGNALS
       When arpd receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, it exits gracefully, syncing the database and restoring adjusted  sysctl  pa‐
       rameters.  On  a  SIGHUP  it  syncs the database to disk. With SIGUSR1 it sends some statistics to syslog. The effect of any
       other signals is undefined. In particular, they may corrupt the database and leave the sysctl parameters in an unpredictable
       state.

NOTE
       In  order  for arpd to be able to serve as ARP resolver, the kernel must be compiled with the option CONFIG_ARPD and, in the
       case when interface list in not given on command  line,  variable  app_solicit  on  interfaces  of  interest  should  be  in
       /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*. If this is not made arpd still collects gratuitous ARP information in its database.

EXAMPLES
       arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db
              Start arpd to collect gratuitous ARP, but not messing with kernel functionality.

       killall arpd ; arpd -l -b /var/tmp/arpd.db
              Look at result after some time.

       arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 1 eth0 eth1
              Enable kernel helper, leaving leading role to kernel.

       arpd -b /var/tmp/arpd.db -a 3 -k eth0 eth1
              Completely  replace kernel resolution on interfaces eth0 and eth1. In this case the kernel still does unicast probing
              to validate entries, but all the broadcast activity is suppressed and made under authority of arpd.

       This is the mode in which arpd normally is supposed to work. It is not the default to prevent occasional enabling of too ag‐
       gressive a mode.

                                                           28 June, 2007                                                    ARPD(8)
