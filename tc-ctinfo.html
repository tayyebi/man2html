NAME
       ctinfo - tc connmark processing action

SYNOPSIS
       tc ... action ctinfo [ dscp MASK [STATEMASK] ] [ cpmark [MASK] ] [ zone ZONE ] [ CONTROL ] [ index &lt;INDEX&gt; ]

DESCRIPTION
       CTINFO  (Conntrack  Information) is a tc action for retrieving data from conntrack marks into various fields.  At present it
       has two independent processing modes which may be viewed as sub-functions.

       DSCP mode copies a DSCP stored in conntrack's connmark into the IPv4/v6 diffserv field.  The copying may conditionally occur
       based  on  a  flag  also  stored  in  the connmark.  DSCP mode was designed to assist in restoring packet classifications on
       ingress, classifications which may then be used by qdiscs such as CAKE.  It may be used in any  circumstance  where  ingress
       classification needs to be maintained across links that otherwise bleach or remap according to their own policies.

       CPMARK  (copymark)  mode  copies  the  conntrack connmark into the packet's mark field.  Without additional parameters it is
       functionally completely equivalent to the existing connmark action.  An optional mask may be specified to mask which bits of
       the connmark are restored.  This may be useful when DSCP and CPMARK modes are combined.

       Simple statistics (tc -s) on DSCP restores and CPMARK copies are maintained where values for set indicate a count of packets
       altered for that mode.  DSCP includes an error count where the destination packet's diffserv field was unwriteable.

PARAMETERS
   DSCP mode parameters:
       mask   A mask of 6 contiguous bits indicating where the DSCP value is located in the 32 bit conntrack mark  field.   A  mask
              must be provided for this mode.  mask is a 32 bit unsigned value.

       statemask
              A  mask  of at least 1 bit indicating where a conditional restore flag is located in the 32 bit conntrack mark field.
              The statemask bit/s must NOT overlap the mask bits.  The DSCP will be restored if the conntrack mark logically  ANDed
              with the statemask yields a non-zero result.  statemask is an optional unsigned 32 bit value.

   CPMARK mode parameters:
       mask   Store the logically ANDed result of conntrack mark and mask into the packet's mark field.  Default is 0xffffffff i.e.
              the whole mark field.  mask is an optional unsigned 32 bit value

   Overall action parameters:
       zone   Specify the conntrack zone when doing conntrack lookups for packets.  zone is a 16bit unsigned  decimal  value.   De‐
              fault is 0.

       CONTROL
              The  following keywords allow one to control how the tree of qdisc, classes, filters and actions is further traversed
              after this action.

              reclassify
                     Restart with the first filter in the current list.

              pipe   Continue with the next action attached to the same filter.

              drop   Drop the packet.

              shot   synonym for drop

              continue
                     Continue classification with the next filter in line.

              pass   Finish classification process and return to calling qdisc for further packet processing. This is the default.

       index  Specify an index for this action in order to being able to identify it in later commands. index is a  32bit  unsigned
              decimal value.

EXAMPLES
       Example showing conditional restoration of DSCP on ingress via an IFB

              #Set up the IFB interface
              tc qdisc add dev ifb4eth0 handle ffff: ingress

              #Put CAKE qdisc on it
              tc qdisc add dev ifb4eth0 root cake bandwidth 40mbit

              #Set interface UP
              ip link set dev ifb4eth0 up

              #Add 2 actions, ctinfo to restore dscp &amp; mirred to redirect the packets to IFB
              tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: protocol all prio 10 u32 \
                  match u32 0 0 flowid 1:1 action    \
                  ctinfo dscp 0xfc000000 0x01000000  \
                  mirred egress redirect dev ifb4eth0

              tc -s qdisc show dev eth0 ingress

               filter parent ffff: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0
               filter parent ffff: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0 fh 800: ht divisor 1

                match 00000000/00000000 at 0
                  action order 1: ctinfo zone 0 pipe

                  action order 2: mirred (Egress Redirect to device ifb4eth0) stolen
                  index 1 ref 1 bind 1 installed 72 sec used 0 sec
                  Action statistics:
                  Sent 658484 bytes 1833 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)

       Example showing conditional restoration of DSCP on egress

       This may appear nonsensical since iptables marking of egress packets is easy to achieve, however the iptables flow classifi‐
       cation rules may be extensive and so some sort of set once and forget may be useful especially on cpu constrained devices.

              # Send unmarked connections to a marking chain which needs to store a DSCP
              and set statemask bit in the connmark
              iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -m connmark \
                  --mark 0x00000000/0x01000000 -g CLASS_MARKING_CHAIN

              # Apply marked DSCP to the packets
              tc filter add dev eth0 protocol all prio 10 u32 \
                  match u32 0 0 flowid 1:1 action \
                  ctinfo dscp 0xfc000000 0x01000000

              tc -s filter show dev eth0
               filter parent 800e: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0
               filter parent 800e: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0 fh 800: ht divisor 1
               filter parent 800e: protocol all pref 10 u32 chain 0 fh 800::800 order 2048 key ht 800 bkt 0 flowid 1:1 not_in_hw
                match 00000000/00000000 at 0
                  action order 1: ctinfo zone 0 pipe
                  index 1 ref 1 bind 1 dscp 0xfc000000 0x01000000 installed 7414 sec used 0 sec DSCP set 53404 error 0 CPMARK set 0
