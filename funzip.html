NAME
       funzip - filter for extracting from a ZIP archive in a pipe

SYNOPSIS
       funzip [-password] [input[.zip|.gz]]

ARGUMENTS
       [-password]
              Optional  password  to  be used if ZIP archive is encrypted.  Decryption may not be supported at some sites.  See DE‐
              SCRIPTION for more details.

       [input[.zip|.gz]]
              Optional input archive file specification. See DESCRIPTION for details.

DESCRIPTION
       funzip without a file argument acts as a filter; that is, it assumes that a ZIP archive (or a gzip'd(1) file) is being piped
       into  standard input, and it extracts the first member from the archive to stdout.  When stdin comes from a tty device, fun‐
       zip assumes that this cannot be a stream of (binary) compressed data and shows a short help text, instead.  If  there  is  a
       file argument, then input is read from the specified file instead of from stdin.

       A  password  for encrypted zip files can be specified on the command line (preceding the file name, if any) by prefixing the
       password with a dash.  Note that this constitutes a security risk on many systems; currently  running  processes  are  often
       visible via simple commands (e.g., ps(1) under Unix), and command-line histories can be read.  If the first entry of the zip
       file is encrypted and no password is specified on the command line, then the user is prompted for a password and  the  pass‐
       word is not echoed on the console.

       Given  the  limitation  on  single-member extraction, funzip is most useful in conjunction with a secondary archiver program
       such as tar(1).  The following section includes an example illustrating this usage in the case of disk backups to tape.

EXAMPLES
       To use funzip to extract the first member file of the archive test.zip and to pipe it into more(1):

       funzip test.zip | more

       To use funzip to test the first member file of test.zip (any errors will be reported on standard error):

       funzip test.zip &gt; /dev/null

       To use zip and funzip in place of compress(1) and zcat(1) (or gzip(1) and gzcat(1)) for tape backups:

       tar cf - . | zip -7 | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=8k
       dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=8k | funzip | tar xf -

       (where, for example, nrst0 is a SCSI tape drive).

BUGS
       When piping an encrypted file into more and allowing funzip to prompt for password, the terminal may sometimes be reset to a
       non-echo  mode.   This  is  apparently due to a race condition between the two programs; funzip changes the terminal mode to
       non-echo before more reads its state, and more then ``restores'' the terminal to this mode before exiting.  To recover,  run
       funzip on the same file but redirect to /dev/null rather than piping into more; after prompting again for the password, fun‐
       zip will reset the terminal properly.

       There is presently no way to extract any member but the first from a ZIP archive.  This would be useful in the case where  a
       ZIP  archive  is  included within another archive.  In the case where the first member is a directory, funzip simply creates
       the directory and exits.

       The functionality of funzip should be incorporated into unzip itself (future release).
