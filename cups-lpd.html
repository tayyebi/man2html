NAME
       cups-lpd - receive print jobs and report printer status to lpd clients (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       cups-lpd [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -n ] [ -o option=value ]

DESCRIPTION
       cups-lpd  is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") mini-server that supports legacy client systems that use the LPD protocol.
       cups-lpd does not act as a standalone network daemon but instead operates using any of the Internet "super-servers" such  as
       inetd(8), launchd(8), and systemd(8).

OPTIONS
       -h hostname[:port]
            Sets the CUPS server (and port) to use.

       -n   Disables  reverse  address lookups; normally cups-lpd will try to discover the hostname of the client via a reverse DNS
            lookup.

       -o name=value
            Inserts options for all print queues. Most often this is used to disable the "l" filter so that remote print  jobs  are
            filtered  as  needed  for printing; the inetd(8) example below sets the "document-format" option to "application/octet-
            stream" which forces autodetection of the print file format.

CONFORMING TO
       cups-lpd does not enforce the restricted source port number specified in RFC 1179, as using restricted ports does  not  pre‐
       vent  users  from  submitting  print  jobs.  While this behavior is different than standard Berkeley LPD implementations, it
       should not affect normal client operations.

       The output of the status requests follows RFC 2569, Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols. Since  many  LPD  implementations
       stray from this definition, remote status reporting to LPD clients may be unreliable.

ERRORS
       Errors are sent to the system log.

FILES
       /etc/inetd.conf
       /etc/xinetd.d/cups-lpd
       /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cups-lpd.plist

NOTES
       The cups-lpd program is deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future feature release of CUPS.

   PERFORMANCE
       cups-lpd performs well with small numbers of clients and printers.  However, since a new process is created for each connec‐
       tion and since each process must query the printing system before each job submission, it does not scale to larger  configu‐
       rations.  We highly recommend that large configurations use the native IPP support provided by CUPS instead.

   SECURITY
       cups-lpd  currently  does  not perform any access control based on the settings in cupsd.conf(5) or in the hosts.allow(5) or
       hosts.deny(5) files used by TCP wrappers.  Therefore, running cups-lpd on your server will allow any computer on  your  net‐
       work (and perhaps the entire Internet) to print to your server.

       While  xinetd(8)  has built-in access control support, you should use the TCP wrappers package with inetd(8) to limit access
       to only those computers that should be able to print through your server.

       cups-lpd is not enabled by the standard CUPS distribution.  Please consult with your operating system  vendor  to  determine
       whether it is enabled by default on your system.

EXAMPLE
       If you are using inetd(8), add the following line to the inetd.conf file to enable the cups-lpd mini-server:

           printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd \
               -o document-format=application/octet-stream

       CUPS  includes  configuration files for launchd(8), systemd(8), and xinetd(8).  Simply enable the cups-lpd service using the
       corresponding control program.
