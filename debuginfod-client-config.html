DEBUGINFOD-CLIENT-CONFIG(7)                       Miscellaneous Information Manual                      DEBUGINFOD-CLIENT-CONFIG(7)

NAME
       debuginfod-client-config - debuginfod client environment variables, cache control files and etc.

SYNOPSIS
       Several environment variables and control files control the behaviour of debuginfod client applications.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       $TMPDIR
              This environment variable points to a file system to be used for temporary files.  The default is /tmp.

       $DEBUGINFOD_URLS
              This  environment  variable contains a list of URL prefixes for trusted debuginfod instances.  Alternate URL prefixes
              are separated by space.  This environment variable  may  be  set  by  /etc/profile.d  scripts  reading  /etc/debugin‐
              fod/*.urls files.

       $DEBUGINFOD_CACHE_PATH
              This  environment variable governs the location of the cache where downloaded files and cache-control files are kept.
              The default directory is chosen based on other environment variables, see below.

       $DEBUGINFOD_PROGRESS
              This environment variable governs the default progress function.  If set, and if a progressfn is not explicitly  set,
              then  the  library will configure a default progressfn.  This function will append a simple progress message periodi‐
              cally to stderr.  The default is no progress function output.

       $DEBUGINFOD_VERBOSE
              This environment variable governs the default file descriptor for verbose output.  If set, and if a verbose fd is not
              explicitly set, then the verbose output will be produced on STDERR_FILENO.

       $DEBUGINFOD_RETRY_LIMIT
              This  environment  variable  governs  the  default  limit  of retry attempts. If a query failed with errno other than
              ENOENT, will initiate several attempts within the limit.

       $DEBUGINFOD_TIMEOUT
              This environment variable governs the download commencing timeout for each debuginfod HTTP connection.  A server that
              fails to provide at least 100K of data within this many seconds is skipped. The default is 90 seconds.  (Zero or neg‐
              ative means "no timeout".)

       $DEBUGINFOD_MAXTIME
              This environment variable dictates how long the client will wait to complete the download a file found on a server in
              seconds.  It  is  best  used  to  ensure that a file is downloaded quickly or be rejected. The default is 0 (infinite
              time).

       $DEBUGINFOD_MAXSIZE
              This environment variable dictates the maximum size of a file to download in bytes. This is best  used  if  the  user
              would  like  to ensure only small files are downloaded. A value of 0 causes no consideration for size, and the client
              may attempt to download a file of any size.  The default is 0 (infinite size).

       $DEBUGINFOD_HEADERS_FILE
              This environment variable points to a file that supplies headers to outbound HTTP requests, one per line. The  header
              lines shouldn't end with CRLF, unless that's the system newline convention. Whitespace-only lines are skipped.

CACHE
       Before  each  query, the debuginfod client library checks for a need to clean the cache.  If it's time to clean, the library
       traverses the cache directory and removes downloaded debuginfo-related artifacts and newly empty directories, if  they  have
       not been accessed recently.

       Control files are located directly under the cache directory.  They contain simple decimal numbers to set cache-related con‐
       figuration parameters.  If the files do not exist, the client library creates the files with the default parameter values as
       content.

       After each query, the debuginfod client library deposits newly received files into a directory &amp; file that is named based on
       the build-id.  A failed query is also cached by a special file.  The naming convention used for these artifacts is  deliber‐
       ately undocumented.

       $XDG_CACHE_HOME/debuginfod_client/
              Default cache directory, if $XDG_CACHE_HOME is set.

       $HOME/.cache/debuginfod_client/
              Default cache directory, if $XDG_CACHE_HOME is not set.

       $HOME/.debuginfod_client_cache/
              Deprecated cache directory, used only if preexisting.

       cache_clean_interval_s
              This  control  file  gives the interval between cache cleaning rounds, in seconds.  The default is 86400, one day.  0
              means "immediately".

       max_unused_age_s
              This control file sets how long unaccessed debuginfo-related files are retained, in seconds.  The default is  604800,
              one week.  0 means "immediately".

       cache_miss_s
              This  control  file sets how long to remember a query failure, in seconds.  New queries for the same artifacts within
              this time window are short-circuited (returning an immediate failure instead of sending  a  new  query  to  servers).
              This  accelerates  queries  that probably would still fail.  The default is 600, 10 minutes.  0 means "forget immedi‐
              ately".

                                                                                                        DEBUGINFOD-CLIENT-CONFIG(7)
