NAME
       ico - animate an icosahedron or other polyhedron

SYNOPSIS
       ico  [-display  display]  [-geometry  geometry]  [-r]  [-d pattern] [-i] [-dbl] [-faces] [-noedges] [-sleep n] [-obj object]
       [-colors color-list]

       ico -objhelp

       ico -version

DESCRIPTION
       Ico displays a wire-frame rotating polyhedron, with hidden lines removed, or a solid-fill polyhedron with hidden  faces  re‐
       moved.  There are a number of different polyhedra available; adding a new polyhedron to the program is quite simple.

OPTIONS
       -r     Display on the root window instead of creating a new window.

       -d pattern
              Specify a bit pattern for drawing dashed lines for wire frames.

       -i     Use inverted colors for wire frames.

       -dbl   Use  double buffering on the display.  This works for either wire frame or solid fill drawings.  For solid fill draw‐
              ings, using this switch results in substantially smoother movement.  Note that this requires twice as many bit planes
              as  without double buffering.  Since some colors are typically allocated by other programs, most eight-bit-plane dis‐
              plays will probably be limited to eight colors when using double buffering.

       -faces Draw filled faces instead of wire frames.

       -noedges
              Don't draw the wire frames.  Typically used only when -faces is used.

       -sleep n
              Sleep n seconds between each move of the object.

       -obj object
              Specify what object to draw.  If no object is specified, an icosahedron is drawn.

       -objhelp
              Print out a list of the available objects, along with information about each object.

       -colors color color ...
              Specify what colors should be used to draw the filled faces of the object.  If less colors than faces are given,  the
              colors are reused.

       -version
              Print program version information and exit.

PROGRAM TERMINATION
       Pressing  "q"  will close a window. If compiled with threads support, the program will stop only when all threads terminate.
       You can also close an animation window using the ICCCM delete message (depending on your window manager,  you  will  have  a
       decoration button or menu to send such message).

ADDING POLYHEDRA
       If  you have the source to ico, it is very easy to add more polyhedra.  Each polyhedron is defined in an include file by the
       name of objXXX.h, where XXX is something related to the name of the polyhedron.  The format of the include file  is  defined
       in  the file polyinfo.h.  Look at the file objcube.h to see what the exact format of an objXXX.h file should be, then create
       your objXXX.h file in that format.

       After making the new objXXX.h file (or copying in a new one from elsewhere), simply do a 'make depend'.  This will  recreate
       the  file  allobjs.h, which lists all of the objXXX.h files.  Doing a 'make' after this will rebuild ico with the new object
       information.

BUGS
       Pyramids and tetrahedrons with filled faces do not display correctly.

       A separate color cell is allocated for each name in the -colors list, even when the same name may be specified twice.  Color
       allocation fails in TrueColor displays and option -faces does not work well.
