<pre>Glib::ParseXSDoc(3pm)                           User Contributed Perl Documentation                           Glib::ParseXSDoc(3pm)

NAME
       Glib::ParseXSDoc - Parse POD and XSub declarations from XS files.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the heart of an automatic API reference documentation system for XS-based Perl modules.  FIXME more info here!!

       FIXME document recognized POD directives and the output data structures

FUNCTIONS
       xsdocparse (@filenames)
           Parse xs files for xsub signatures and pod.  Writes to standard output a data structure suitable for eval'ing in another
           Perl script, describing all the stuff found.  The output contains three variables:

           $xspods = ARRAYREF
               array of pods found in the verbatim C portion of the XS file, listed in the order found.  These are assumed to
               pertain to the XS/C api, not the Perl api.  Any "=for apidoc" paragraphs following an "=object" paragraphs in the
               verbatim sections are stripped (as are the "=object" paragraphs), and will appear instead in
               "$data-&gt;{$package}{pods}".

           $data = HASHREF
               big hash keyed by package name (as found in the MODULE line), containing under each key a hash with all the xsubs
               and pods in that package, in the order found.  Packages are consolidated across multiple files.

           FYI, this creates a new parser and calls "parse_file" on it for each input filename; then calls "swizzle_pods" to ensure
           that any "=for apidoc name" pods are matched up with their target xsubs; and finally calls Data::Dumper to write the
           data to stdout.  So, if you want to get finer control over how the output is created, or keep all the data in-process,
           now you know how.  :-)

METHODS
       $Glib::ParseXSDoc::verbose
           If true, this causes the parser to be verbose.

       $parser = Glib::ParseXSDoc-&gt;new
           Create a new xsub parser.

       string = $parser-&gt;package
           Get the current package name.  Falls back to the module name.  Will be undef if the parser hasn't reached the first
           MODULE line.

       HASHREF = $parser-&gt;pkgdata
           The data hash corresponding to the current package, honoring the most recently encountered "=for object" directive.
           Ensures that it exists.  Returns a reference to the member of the main data structure, so modifications are permanent
           and useful.

       $parser-&gt;parse_file (filename)
           Parse one xs file.  Stores all the collected data in $parser's internal data structures.

       $parser-&gt;swizzle_pods
           Match "=for apidoc" pods to xsubs.

       $parser-&gt;preprocess_pods
           Honor the "__hide__" and "__function__" directives in "=for apidoc" lines.

           We look for the strings anywhere, but you'll typically have it at the end of the line, e.g.:

             =for apidoc symname __hide__        for detached blocks
             =for apidoc __hide__                for attached blocks

             =for apidoc symname __function__    for functions rather than methods
             =for apidoc __function__            for functions rather than methods

       bool = $parser-&gt;is_module_line ($line)
           Analyze $line to see if it contains an XS MODULE directive.  If so, returns true after setting the $parser's module,
           package, and prefix accordingly.

       $pod = $parser-&gt;slurp_pod_paragraph ($firstline, $term_regex=/^=cut\s*/)
           Slurp up POD lines from $filehandle from here to the next $term_regex or EOF.  Since you probably already read a line to
           determine that we needed to start a pod, you can pass that first line to be included.

       $xsub = $parser-&gt;parse_xsub (\@lines)
       $xsub = $parser-&gt;parse_xsub (@lines)
           Parse an xsub header, in the form of a list of lines, into a data structure describing the xsub.  That includes pulling
           out the argument types, aliases, and code type.

           Without artificial intelligence, we cannot reliably determine anything about the types or number of parameters returned
           from xsubs with PPCODE bodies.

           OUTLIST parameters are pulled from the args list and put into an "outlist" key.  IN_OUTLIST parameters are put into
           both.

           Data type names are not mangled at all.

           Note that the method can take either a list of lines or a reference to a list of lines.  The flat list form is provided
           for compatibility; the reference form is preferred, to avoid duplicating a potentially large list of strings.

       $parser-&gt;clean_out_empty_pods
           Looks through the data member of the parser and removes any keys (and associated values) when no pod, enums, and xsubs
           exist for the package.
