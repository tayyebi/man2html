NAME
       dirmngr - GnuPG's network access daemon

SYNOPSIS
       dirmngr [options] command [args]

DESCRIPTION
       Since  version  2.1  of GnuPG, dirmngr takes care of accessing the OpenPGP keyservers.  As with previous versions it is also
       used as a server for managing and downloading certificate revocation lists (CRLs) for X.509 certificates, downloading  X.509
       certificates,  and providing access to OCSP providers.  Dirmngr is invoked internally by gpg, gpgsm, or via the gpg-connect-
       agent tool.

COMMANDS
       Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that only one command is allowed.

       --version
              Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

       --help, -h
              Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line options.  Note that you cannot  abbreviate  this  com‐
              mand.

       --dump-options
              Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

       --server
              Run  in  server  mode and wait for commands on the stdin.  The default mode is to create a socket and listen for com‐
              mands there.  This is only used for testing.

       --daemon
              Run in background daemon mode and listen for commands on a socket.  This is the way dirmngr is started on  demand  by
              the other GnuPG components.  To force starting dirmngr it is in general best to use gpgconf --launch dirmngr.

       --supervised
              Run  in  the foreground, sending logs to stderr, and listening on file descriptor 3, which must already be bound to a
              listening socket.  This is useful when running under systemd or other similar process supervision schemes.  This  op‐
              tion is not supported on Windows.

       --list-crls
              List the contents of the CRL cache on stdout. This is probably only useful for debugging purposes.

       --load-crl file
              This  command requires a filename as additional argument, and it will make Dirmngr try to import the CRL in file into
              it's cache.  Note, that this is only possible if Dirmngr is able to retrieve the CA's certificate directly by its own
              means.   In  general it is better to use gpgsm's --call-dirmngr loadcrl filename command so that gpgsm can help dirm‐
              ngr.

       --fetch-crl url
              This command requires an URL as additional argument, and it will make dirmngr try to retrieve and import the CRL from
              that  url  into it's cache.  This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.  The dirmngr-client provides the same fea‐
              ture for a running dirmngr.

       --shutdown
              This commands shuts down an running instance of Dirmngr.  This command has currently no effect.

       --flush
              This command removes all CRLs from Dirmngr's cache.  Client requests will thus trigger reading of fresh CRLs.

OPTIONS
       Note that all long options with the exception of --options and --homedir may also be given in the configuration  file  after
       stripping off the two leading dashes.

       --options file
              Reads  configuration  from  file  instead of from the default per-user configuration file.  The default configuration
              file is named ‘dirmngr.conf’ and expected in the home directory.

       --homedir dir
              Set the name of the home directory to dir.  This option is only effective when used on the command line.  The default
              is  the  directory  named  ‘.gnupg’  directly  below  the  home directory of the user unless the environment variable
              GNUPGHOME has been set in which case its value will be used.  Many kinds of data are stored within this directory.

       -v

       --verbose
              Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the verbosity by giving several verbose  commands  to
              dirmngr, such as -vv.

       --log-file file
              Append  all logging output to file.  This is very helpful in seeing what the agent actually does.  Use ‘socket://’ to
              log to socket.

       --debug-level level
              Select the debug level for investigating problems.  level may be a numeric value or by a keyword:

              none   No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used instead of the keyword.

              basic  Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be used instead of the keyword.

              advanced
                     More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be used instead of the keyword.

              expert Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be used instead of the keyword.

              guru   All of the debug messages you can get. A value greater than 8 may be used instead of the  keyword.   The  cre‐
                     ation of hash tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

       How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not specified and may change with newer releases of this pro‐
       gram. They are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

       --debug flags
              Set debugging flags.  This option is only useful for debugging and its behavior may change with a new  release.   All
              flags are or-ed and may be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042) or as a comma separated list of flag names.  To get a list
              of all supported flags the single word "help" can be used.

       --debug-all
              Same as --debug=0xffffffff

       --tls-debug level
              Enable debugging of the TLS layer at level.  The details of the debug level depend on the used TLS  library  and  are
              not set in stone.

       --debug-wait n
              When running in server mode, wait n seconds before entering the actual processing loop and print the pid.  This gives
              time to attach a debugger.

       --disable-check-own-socket
              On some platforms dirmngr is able to detect the removal of its socket file and shutdown itself.  This option  disable
              this self-test for debugging purposes.

       -s
       --sh
       -c
       --csh  Format  the  info output in daemon mode for use with the standard Bourne shell respective the C-shell. The default is
              to guess it based on the environment variable SHELL which is in almost all cases sufficient.

       --force
              Enabling this option forces loading of expired CRLs; this is only useful for debugging.

       --use-tor
       --no-use-tor
              The option --use-tor switches Dirmngr and thus GnuPG into ``Tor mode'' to  route  all  network  access  via  Tor  (an
              anonymity  network).  Certain other features are disabled in this mode.  The effect of --use-tor cannot be overridden
              by any other command or even by reloading dirmngr.  The use of --no-use-tor disables the use of Tor.  The default  is
              to  use  Tor  if  it is available on startup or after reloading dirmngr.  The test on the available of Tor is done by
              trying to connects to a SOCKS proxy at either port 9050 or 9150); if another type of proxy is  listening  on  one  of
              these ports, you should use --no-use-tor.

       --standard-resolver
              This option forces the use of the system's standard DNS resolver code.  This is mainly used for debugging.  Note that
              on Windows a standard resolver is not used and all DNS access will return the error ``Not Implemented'' if  this  op‐
              tion is used.  Using this together with enabled Tor mode returns the error ``Not Enabled''.

       --recursive-resolver
              When possible use a recursive resolver instead of a stub resolver.

       --resolver-timeout n
              Set the timeout for the DNS resolver to N seconds.  The default are 30 seconds.

       --connect-timeout n

       --connect-quick-timeout n
              Set  the  timeout for HTTP and generic TCP connection attempts to N seconds.  The value set with the quick variant is
              used when the --quick option has been given to certain Assuan commands.  The quick value is capped at  the  value  of
              the  regular  connect  timeout.   The default values are 15 and 2 seconds.  Note that the timeout values are for each
              connection attempt; the connection code will attempt to connect all addresses listed for a server.

       --listen-backlog n
              Set the size of the queue for pending connections.  The default is 64.

       --allow-version-check
              Allow Dirmngr to connect to https://versions.gnupg.org to get the list of current software versions.  On debian-pack‐
              aged versions, this option does nothing since software updates should be handled by the distribution.  See the option
              --query-swdb of the command gpgconf for more details.  Note, that regardless of this option a version check  can  al‐
              ways be triggered using this command:

                gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr 'loadswdb --force' /bye

       --keyserver name
              Use name as your keyserver.  This is the server that gpg communicates with to receive keys, send keys, and search for
              keys.  The format of the name is a URI: `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]' The scheme is the type of keyserver:  "hkp"
              for  the  HTTP (or compatible) keyservers, "ldap" for the LDAP keyservers, or "mailto" for the Graff email keyserver.
              Note that your particular installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver types available as well.  Keyserver  schemes
              are  case-insensitive. After the keyserver name, optional keyserver configuration options may be provided.  These are
              the same as the --keyserver-options of gpg, but apply only to this particular keyserver.

              Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no need to send keys  to  more  than  one  server.
              Somes keyservers use round robin DNS to give a different keyserver each time you use it.

              If exactly two keyservers are configured and only one is a Tor hidden service (.onion), Dirmngr selects the keyserver
              to use depending on whether Tor is locally running or not.  The check for a running Tor is done for each new  connec‐
              tion.

              If no keyserver is explicitly configured, dirmngr will use the built-in default of https://keys.openpgp.org.

              Note  that  the  above default is a Debian-specific choice.  Upstream GnuPG prefers hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com.  See
              /usr/share/doc/gpgconf/NEWS.Debian.gz for more details.

              Windows users with a keyserver running on their Active Directory may use the short form ldap:/// for name  to  access
              this directory.

              For  accessing  anonymous  LDAP  keyservers  name  is in general just a ldaps://ldap.example.com.  A BaseDN parameter
              should never be specified.  If authentication is required things are more complicated and two methods are available:

              The modern method (since version 2.2.28) is to use the very same syntax as used with the option --ldapserver.  Please
              see over there for details; here is an example:

                keyserver ldap:ldap.example.com::uid=USERNAME,ou=GnuPG Users,
                dc=example,dc=com:PASSWORD::starttls

              The other method is to use a full URL for name; for example:

                keyserver ldaps://ldap.example.com/????bindname=uid=USERNAME
                %2Cou=GnuPG%20Users%2Cdc=example%2Cdc=com,password=PASSWORD

              Put this all on one line without any spaces and keep the '%2C'
              as given.  Replace USERNAME, PASSWORD, and the 'dc' parts
              according to the instructions received from your LDAP
              administrator.  Note that only simple authentication
              (i.e. cleartext passwords) is supported and thus using ldaps is
              strongly suggested (since 2.2.28 "ldaps" defaults to port 389
              and uses STARTTLS).  On Windows authentication via AD can be
              requested by adding gpgNtds=1 after the fourth question
              mark instead of the bindname and password parameter.

       --nameserver ipaddr
              In  ``Tor  mode'' Dirmngr uses a public resolver via Tor to resolve DNS names.  If the default public resolver, which
              is 8.8.8.8, shall not be used a different one can be given using this option.  Note that a numerical IP address  must
              be given (IPv6 or IPv4) and that no error checking is done for ipaddr.

       --disable-ipv4

       --disable-ipv6
              Disable the use of all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

       --disable-ldap
              Entirely disables the use of LDAP.

       --disable-http
              Entirely disables the use of HTTP.

       --ignore-http-dp
              When  looking  for  the  location  of a CRL, the to be tested certificate usually contains so called CRL Distribution
              Point (DP) entries which are URLs describing the way to access the CRL.  The first found DP entry is used.  With this
              option all entries using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.

       --ignore-ldap-dp
              This  is similar to --ignore-http-dp but ignores entries using the LDAP scheme.  Both options may be combined result‐
              ing in ignoring DPs entirely.

       --ignore-ocsp-service-url
              Ignore all OCSP URLs contained in the certificate.  The effect is to force the use of the default responder.

       --honor-http-proxy
              If the environment variable ‘http_proxy’ has been set, use its value to access HTTP servers.

       --http-proxy [http://]host[:port]
              Use host and port to access HTTP servers.  The use of this option overrides the environment variable ‘http_proxy’ re‐
              gardless whether --honor-http-proxy has been set.

       --ldap-proxy host[:port]
              Use host and port to connect to LDAP servers.  If port is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.  This over‐
              rides any specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if host and port have  been  omitted  from
              the URL.

       --only-ldap-proxy
              Never  use  anything  else  but the LDAP "proxy" as configured with --ldap-proxy.  Usually dirmngr tries to use other
              configured LDAP server if the connection using the "proxy" failed.

       --ldapserverlist-file file
              Read the list of LDAP servers to consult for CRLs and X.509 certificates from file instead of  the  default  per-user
              ldap server list file. The default value for file is ‘dirmngr_ldapservers.conf’.

              This server list file contains one LDAP server per line in the format

              hostname:port:username:password:base_dn:flags

              Lines starting with a  ‘#’ are comments.

              Note that as usual all strings entered are expected to be UTF-8 encoded.  Obviously this will lead to problems if the
              password has originally been encoded as Latin-1.  There is no other solution here than to put such a password in  the
              binary encoding into the file (i.e. non-ascii characters won't show up readable). ([The gpgconf tool might be helpful
              for frontends as it enables editing this configuration file using percent-escaped strings.])

       --ldapserver spec
              This is an alternative way to specify LDAP servers for CRL and X.509 certificate retrieval.  If this option  is  used
              the  servers configured in ‘dirmngr_ldapservers.conf’ (or the file given by --ldapserverlist-file) are cleared.  Note
              that ‘dirmngr_ldapservers.conf’ is not read again by a reload signal. However, --ldapserver options are read again.

              spec is either a proper LDAP URL or a colon delimited list of the form

              hostname:port:username:password:base_dn:flags:

              with an optional prefix of ldap: (but without the two slashes which would turn this into a proper LDAP  URL).   flags
              is a list of one or more comma delimited keywords:

              plain  The default: Do not use a TLS secured connection at all; the default port is 389.

              starttls
                     Use STARTTLS to secure the connection; the default port is 389.

              ldaptls
                     Tunnel LDAP through a TLS connection; the default port is 636.

              ntds   On Windows authenticate the LDAP connection using the Active Directory with the current user.

              areconly
                     On Windows use only the A or AAAA record when resolving the LDAP server name.

       Note that in an URL style specification the scheme ldaps:// refers to STARTTLS and _not_ to LDAP-over-TLS.

       --ldaptimeout secs
              Specify the number of seconds to wait for an LDAP query before timing out.  The default are 15 seconds.  0 will never
              timeout.

       --add-servers
              This option makes dirmngr add any servers it discovers when validating certificates against CRLs to the internal list
              of servers to consult for certificates and CRLs.

              This option is useful when trying to validate a certificate that has a CRL distribution point that points to a server
              that is not already listed in the ldapserverlist. Dirmngr will always go to this server and try to download the  CRL,
              but  chances  are high that the certificate used to sign the CRL is located on the same server. So if dirmngr doesn't
              add that new server to list, it will often not be able to verify the signature of the CRL  unless  the  --add-servers
              option is used.

              Note: The current version of dirmngr has this option disabled by default.

       --allow-ocsp
              This option enables OCSP support if requested by the client.

              OCSP requests are rejected by default because they may violate the privacy of the user; for example it is possible to
              track the time when a user is reading a mail.

       --ocsp-responder url
              Use url as the default OCSP Responder if the certificate does not contain information about  an  assigned  responder.
              Note, that --ocsp-signer must also be set to a valid certificate.

       --ocsp-signer fpr|file
              Use  the  certificate with the fingerprint fpr to check the responses of the default OCSP Responder.  Alternatively a
              filename can be given in which case the response is expected to be signed by one of  the  certificates  described  in
              that  file.   Any  argument  which contains a slash, dot or tilde is considered a filename.  Usual filename expansion
              takes place: A tilde at the start followed by a slash is replaced by the content of ‘HOME’, no  slash  at  start  de‐
              scribes  a relative filename which will be searched at the home directory.  To make sure that the file is searched in
              the home directory, either prepend the name with "./" or use a name which contains a dot.

              If a response has been signed by a certificate described by these fingerprints no further check upon the validity  of
              this certificate is done.

              The  format  of  the FILE is a list of SHA-1 fingerprint, one per line with optional colons between the bytes.  Empty
              lines and lines prefix with a hash mark are ignored.

       --ocsp-max-clock-skew n
              The number of seconds a skew between the OCSP responder and them local clock is accepted.  Default is  600  (10  min‐
              utes).

       --ocsp-max-period n
              Seconds  a  response is at maximum considered valid after the time given in the thisUpdate field.  Default is 7776000
              (90 days).

       --ocsp-current-period n
              The number of seconds an OCSP response is considered valid after the time given in the NEXT_UPDATE datum.  Default is
              10800 (3 hours).

       --max-replies n
              Do not return more that n items in one query.  The default is 10.

       --ignore-cert-extension oid
              Add  oid  to  the  list  of  ignored  certificate extensions.  The oid is expected to be in dotted decimal form, like
              2.5.29.3.  This option may be used more than once.  Critical flagged certificate extensions matching one of the  OIDs
              in  the list are treated as if they are actually handled and thus the certificate won't be rejected due to an unknown
              critical extension.  Use this option with care because extensions are usually flagged as critical for a reason.

       --ignore-cert fpr|file
              Entirely ignore certificates with the fingerprint fpr.  As an alternative to the fingerprint a filename can be  given
              in which case all certificates described in that file are ignored.  Any argument which contains a slash, dot or tilde
              is considered a filename.  Usual filename expansion takes place: A tilde at the start followed by a slash is replaced
              by  the  content of ‘HOME’, no slash at start describes a relative filename which will be searched at the home direc‐
              tory.  To make sure that the file is searched in the home directory, either prepend the name with "./" or use a  name
              which  contains  a  dot.  The format of such a file is a list of SHA-1 fingerprint, one per line with optional colons
              between the bytes.  Empty lines and lines prefixed with a hash mark are ignored.

              This option is useful as a quick workaround to exclude certain certificates from the system store.

       --hkp-cacert file
              Use the root certificates in file for verification of the TLS certificates used  with  hkps  (keyserver  access  over
              TLS).   If  the file is in PEM format a suffix of .pem is expected for file.  This option may be given multiple times
              to add more root certificates.  Tilde expansion is supported.

              If no hkp-cacert directive is present, dirmngr will use the system CAs.

EXAMPLES
       Here is an example on how to show dirmngr's internal table of OpenPGP keyserver addresses.  The output is intended  for  de‐
       bugging purposes and not part of a defined API.

           gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr 'keyserver --hosttable' /bye

       To inhibit the use of a particular host you have noticed in one of the keyserver pools, you may use

          gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr 'keyserver --dead pgpkeys.bnd.de' /bye

       The description of the keyserver command can be printed using

          gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr 'help keyserver' /bye

FILES
       Dirmngr  makes  use of several directories when running in daemon mode: There are a few configuration files whih control the
       operation of dirmngr.  By default they may all be found in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).

       dirmngr.conf
              This is the standard configuration file read by dirmngr on startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the  lead‐
              ing  two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.  This file is also read after a SIGHUP how‐
              ever not all options will actually have an effect.  This default name may be changed on the command line  (see:  [op‐
              tion --options]).  You should backup this file.

       /etc/gnupg/trusted-certs
              This  directory should be filled with certificates of Root CAs you are trusting in checking the CRLs and signing OCSP
              Responses.

              Usually these are the same certificates you use with the applications making use of dirmngr.   It  is  expected  that
              each  of  these  certificate  files  contain  exactly one DER encoded certificate in a file with the suffix ‘.crt’ or
              ‘.der’.  dirmngr reads those certificates on startup and when given a SIGHUP.  Certificates which are not readable or
              do not make up a proper X.509 certificate are ignored; see the log file for details.

              Applications  using  dirmngr (e.g. gpgsm) can request these certificates to complete a trust chain in the same way as
              with the extra-certs directory (see below).

              Note that for OCSP responses the certificate specified using the option --ocsp-signer is always considered  valid  to
              sign OCSP requests.

       /etc/gnupg/extra-certs
              This  directory  may  contain extra certificates which are preloaded into the internal cache on startup. Applications
              using dirmngr (e.g. gpgsm) can request cached certificates to complete a trust chain.  This is  convenient  in  cases
              you  have  a couple intermediate CA certificates or certificates usually used to sign OCSP responses.  These certifi‐
              cates are first tried before going out to the net to look for them.  These certificates must also be DER encoded  and
              suffixed with ‘.crt’ or ‘.der’.

       ~/.gnupg/crls.d
              This  directory is used to store cached CRLs.  The ‘crls.d’ part will be created by dirmngr if it does not exists but
              you need to make sure that the upper directory exists.

SIGNALS
       A running dirmngr may be controlled by signals, i.e. using the kill command to send a signal to the process.

       Here is a list of supported signals:

       SIGHUP This signal flushes all internally cached CRLs as well as any cached certificates.  Then  the  certificate  cache  is
              reinitialized  as on startup.  Options are re-read from the configuration file.  Instead of sending this signal it is
              better to use
         gpgconf --reload dirmngr

       SIGTERM
              Shuts down the process but waits until all current requests are fulfilled.  If the process has received  3  of  these
              signals and requests are still pending, a shutdown is forced.  You may also use
         gpgconf --kill dirmngr
       instead of this signal

       SIGINT Shuts down the process immediately.

       SIGUSR1
              This prints some caching statistics to the log file.
