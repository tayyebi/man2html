NAME
       axfer-transfer - transferrer of audio data frame for sound devices and nodes.

SYNOPSIS
       axfer transfer direction [ common-options ] [ backend-options ] [ filepath ]

       axfer transfer direction [ common-options ] [ backend-options ] -I | --separate-channels filepath ...

       direction = capture | playback

       common-options = ( read OPTIONS section )

       backend-options = ( read OPTIONS section )

       filepaths = ( read OPTIONS section )

DESCRIPTION
       The  transfer  subcommand  of  axfer performs transmission of audio data frames for devices available in supported backends.
       This program is essentially designed to use alsa-lib APIs (libasound backend) to handle sound  devices  supported  by  Linux
       sound subsystem (ALSA).

OPTIONS
   Direction
       capture
              Operates for capture transmission.

       playback
              Operates for playback transmission.

   Filepath
       Filepath is handled as a path relative to current working directory of run time if it's not full path from root directory.

       The standard input or output is used if filepath is not specified or given as '-' .

       For  playback transmission, container format of given filepath is detected automatically and metadata is used for parameters
       of sample format, channels, rate, duration. If nothing detected, content of given file path is handled as raw data. In  this
       case, the parameters should be indicated as options.

       Multiple  filepaths  are allowed with -I | --separate-channels option. In this case, standard input and output is not avail‐
       able. The same filepath is not allowed except for paths listed below:
        - /dev/null
        - /dev/zero
        - /dev/full
        - /dev/random
        - /dev/urandom

   Common options
       -h, --help
              Print help messages and finish run time.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet mode. Suppress messages (not sound :))

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode. Runtime dumps supplemental information according to the number of this option given in command line.

       -d, --duration=#
              Interrupt after # seconds. A value of zero means infinity. The default is zero, so if this option is omitted then the
              transmission process will run until it is killed. Either -d or -s option is available exclusively.

       -s, --samples=#
              Interrupt  after  transmission of # number of data frames. A value of zero means infinity. The default is zero, so if
              this options is omitted then the transmission process will run until it is killed. Either -d or -s option  is  avail‐
              able exclusively.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              Indicate  format  of audio sample. This is required for capture transmission, or playback transmission with files in‐
              cluding raw audio data.

              Available sample format is listed below:
               - [S8|U8|S16|U16|S32|U32][_LE|_BE]
               - [S24|U24][_LE|_BE]
               - FLOAT[_LE|_BE]
               - FLOAT64[_LE|_BE]
               - IEC958_SUBFRAME[_LE|_BE]
               - MU_LAW
               - A_LAW
               - [S20|U20][_LE|_BE]
               - [S24|U24][_3LE|_3BE]
               - [S20|U20][_3LE|_3BE]
               - [S18|U18][_3LE|_3BE]
               - DSD_U8
               - DSD_[U16|U32][_LE|_BE]

              If endian-ness is omitted, host endian-ness is used.

              Some special formats are available:
               - cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [= -f S16_LE -c 2 -r 44100]
               - cdr (16 bit big endian, 44100, stereo) [= -f S16_BE -c 2 -f 44100]
               - dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [= -f S16_LE -c 2 -r 48000]

              If omitted, U8 is used as a default. Actual available formats are restricted by each transmission backend.

              Unavailable sample format is listed below. These format has size of data frame unaligned to byte unit.

               - IMA_ADPCM
               - MPEG
               - GSM
               - SPECIAL
               - G723_24
               - G723_24_1B
               - G723_40
               - G723_40_1B

       -c, --channels=#
              Indicate the number of audio data samples per frame. This is required for capture transmission, or playback transmis‐
              sion with files including raw audio data. The value should be between 1 to 256 . If omitted, 1 is used as a default.

       -r, --rate=#
              Indicate  the number of audio data frame per second. This is required for capture transmission, or playback transmis‐
              sion with files including raw audio data. If the value is less than 1000 , it's interpreted by kHz  unit.  The  value
              should be between 2000 and 192000 . If omitted, 8000 is used as a default.

       -t, --file-type=TYPE
              Indicate the type of file. This is required for capture transmission. Available types are listed below:
               - wav: Microsoft/IBM RIFF/Wave format
               - au, sparc: Sparc AU format
               - voc: Creative Tech. voice format
               - raw: raw data

              When  nothing  is  indicated, for capture transmission, the type is decided according to suffix of filepath , and raw
              type is used for fallback.

       -I, --separate-channels
              Indicate this option when several files are going to be handled. For capture transmission, if one filepath  is  given
              as filepath , a list of filepaths is generated in a formula '&lt;filepath&gt;-&lt;sequential number&gt;[.suffix]'.  The suffix is
              omitted when raw format of container is used.

       --dump-hw-params
              Dump hardware parameters and finish run time if backend supports it.

       --xfer-backend=BACKEND
              Select backend of transmission from a list below. The default is libasound.
               - libasound
               - libffado (optional if compiled)

   Backend options for libasound
       -D, --device=NODE

              This option is used to select PCM node in libasound configuration space.  Available nodes are listed by pcm operation
              of list subcommand.

       -N, --nonblock

              With  this  option, PCM substream is opened in non-blocking mode. When audio data frame is not available in buffer of
              the PCM substream,  I/O  operation  immediately  returns  without  blocking  process.  This  option  implicitly  uses
              --waiter-type option as well to prevent heavy consumption of CPU time.

       -M, --mmap

              With  this  option,  audio data frame is processed directly in buffer of PCM substream if selected node supports this
              operation. Without the option, temporary buffers are used to copy audio data frame for buffer of PCM substream.  This
              option implicitly uses --waiter-type option as well to prevent heavy consumption of CPU time.

       -F, --period-size=#

              This  option  configures  given value to period_size hardware parameter of PCM substream. The parameter indicates the
              number of audio data frame per period in buffer of the PCM substream. Actual number is decided as a result of  inter‐
              action  between each implementation of PCM plugin chained from the selected PCM node, and in-kernel driver or PCM I/O
              plugins.

              Ideally, the same amount of audio data frame as the value should be handled in one I/O  operation.  Actually,  it  is
              not, depending on implementation of the PCM plugins, in-kernel driver, PCM I/O plugins and scheduling model. For 'hw'
              PCM plugin in 'irq' scheduling model, the value is used to decide intervals of  hardware  interrupt,  thus  the  same
              amount of audio data frame as the value is expected to be available for one I/O operation.

       --period-time=#

              This  option  configures  given  value  to period_time hardware parameter of PCM substream. This option is similar to
              --period-size option, however its unit is micro-second.

       -B, --buffer-size=#

              This option configures given value to buffer_size hardware parameter of PCM substream. The  parameter  indicates  the
              number  of  audio  data frame in buffer of PCM substream. Actual number is decided as a result of interaction between
              each implementation of PCM plugin chained from the selected PCM node, and in-kernel driver or PCM I/O plugins.

              Ideally, this is multiples of the number of audio data frame per period, thus the size of  period.  Actually,  it  is
              not, depending on implementation of the PCM plugins, in-kernel driver and PCM I/O plugins.

       --buffer-time=#

              This  option  configures  given  value  to buffer_time hardware parameter of PCM substream. This option is similar to
              --buffer-size option, however its unit is micro-second.

       --waiter-type=TYPE

              This option indicates the type of waiter for event notification. At present, four types are available; default ,  se‐
              lect  ,  poll  and  epoll . With default type, 'snd_pcm_wait()' is used. With select type, 'select(2)' system call is
              used. With poll type, 'poll(2)' system call is used. With epoll type, Linux-specific 'epoll(7)' system call is used.

              This option should correspond to one of --nonblock or --mmap options, or timer value of --sched-model  option.   Nei‐
              ther this option nor --test-nowait is available at the same time.

       --sched-model=MODEL

              This option selects scheduling model for process of this program. One of irq or timer is available. In detail, please
              read 'SCHEDULING MODEL' section.

              When nothing specified, irq model is used.

       -A, --avail-min=#

              This option configures given value to avail-min software parameter of PCM substream. In blocking mode, the  value  is
              used  as threshold of the number of available audio data frames in buffer of PCM substream to wake up process blocked
              by I/O operation. In non-blocking mode, any I/O operation returns -EAGAIN until the available number  of  audio  data
              frame reaches the threshold.

              This option has an effect in cases neither --mmap nor timer value of --sched-model option is used.

       -R, --start-delay=#

              This  option  configures  given  value  to  start_threshold software parameter of PCM substream. The value is used as
              threshold to start PCM substream automatically. At present, this option has an effect in  cases  neither  --mmap  nor
              timer value of --sched-model option is used.

              For  playback  transmission, when the number of accumulated audio data frame in buffer of PCM substream to which this
              program writes out reaches the threshold, the  PCM  substream  starts  automatically  without  an  explicit  call  of
              snd_pcm_start() to the PCM substream.

              For capture transmission, this option is useless. The number of accumulated audio data frame is not increased without
              an explicit call of snd_pcm_start() to the PCM substream.

              This option has an effect in cases neither --mmap nor timer value of --sched-model option is used.

       -T, --stop-delay=#

              This option configures given value to stop_threshold software parameter of  PCM  substream.  The  value  is  used  as
              threshold  to  stop  PCM  substream  automatically. At present, this option has an effect in cases neither --mmap nor
              timer value of --sched-model option is used.

              For capture transmission, when the number of accumulated audio data frame in buffer  of  PCM  substream  to  which  a
              driver or alsa-lib PCM plugins write reaches the threshold, the PCM substream stops automatically without an explicit
              call of snd_pcm_stop() to the PCM substream. This is a case that this program leaves the audio  data  frames  without
              reading for a while.

              For  playback transmission, when the number available audio data frame in buffer of PCM substream from which a driver
              or alsa-lib PCM plugins read reaches the threshold, the PCM substream stops automatically without an explicit call of
              snd_pcm_stop()  to  the  PCM substream. This is a case that this program leaves the audio data frames without writing
              for a while.

              This option has an effect in cases neither --mmap nor timer value of --sched-model option is used.

       --disable-resample

              This option has an effect for 'plug' plugin in alsa-lib to suppress conversion of sampling rate for audio data frame.

       --disable-channels

              This option has an effect for 'plug' plugin in alsa-lib to suppress conversion of channels for audio data frame.

       --disable-format

              This option has an effect for 'plug' plugin in alsa-lib to suppress conversion of sample format for audio data frame.

       --disable-softvol

              This option has an effect for 'softvol' plugin in alsa-lib to suppress conversion of samples for audio data frame via
              additional control element.

       --fatal-errors

              This  option  suppresses recovery operation from XRUN state of running PCM substream, then process of this program is
              going to finish as usual.

       --test-nowait

              This option disables any waiter for I/O event notification. I/O operations are iterated till any of audio data  frame
              is available. The option brings heavy load in consumption of CPU time.

   Backend options for libffado
       This  backend  is automatically available when configure script detects ffado_streaming_init() symbol in libffado shared ob‐
       ject.

       -p, --port=#

              This option uses given value to decide which 1394 OHCI controller is used to communicate. When Linux system  has  two
              1394  OHCI  controllers,  0  or 1 are available. Neither this option nor -g is available at the same time. If nothing
              specified, libffado performs to communicate to units on IEEE 1394 bus managed by all of 1394 OHCI  controller  avail‐
              able in Linux system.

       -n, --node=#

              This  option uses given value to decide which unit is used to communicate. This option requires -p option to indicate
              which 1394 OHCI controller is used to communicate to the specified unit.

       -g, --guid=HEXADECIMAL

              This option uses given value to decide a target unit to communicate. The value should be prefixed with '0x' and  con‐
              sists  of  hexadecimal  literal letters (0-9, a-f, A-F). Neither this option nor -p is available at the same time. If
              nothing specified, libffado performs to communicate to units on IEEE 1394 bus managed by all of 1394 OHCI  controller
              available in Linux system.

       --frames-per-period=#

              This  option  uses given value to decide the number of audio data frame in one read/write operation. The operation is
              blocked till the number of available audio data frame exceeds the given value. As a default, 512 audio data frames is
              used.

       --periods-per-buffer=#

              This  option  uses  given value to decide the size of intermediate buffer between this program and libffado. As a de‐
              fault, 2 periods per buffer is used.

       --slave

              This option allows this program to run slave mode. In this mode, libffado adds unit directory into configuration  ROM
              of  1394  OHCI controller where Linux system runs. The unit directory can be found by the other node on the same bus.
              Linux system running on the node can transfer isochronous packet with audio data frame to the unit. This program  can
              receive the packet and demultiplex the audio data frame.

       --snoop

              This  option  allows this program to run snoop mode. In this mode, libffado listens isochronous channels to which de‐
              vice transfers isochronous packet. When isochronous communication starts by any unit on the same bus, the packets can
              be handled by this program.

       --sched-priority=#

              This  option  executes pthread_setschedparam() in a call of ffado_streaming_init() to configure scheduling policy and
              given value as its priority for threads related to isochronous communication.   The  given  value  should  be  within
              RLIMIT_RTPRIO parameter of process. Please read getrlimit(2) for details.

POSIX SIGNALS
       During transmission, SIGINT and SIGTERM will close handled files and PCM substream to be going to finish run time.

       SIGTSTP will suspend PCM substream and SIGCONT will resume it. No XRUNs are expected. With libffado backend, the suspend/re‐
       sume is not supported and runtime is aboeted immediately.

       The other signals perform default behaviours.

EXAMPLES
           $ axfer transfer playback -d 1 something

       The above will transfer audio data frame in 'something' file for playback during 1 second.  The sample  format  is  detected
       automatically  as  a result to parse 'something' as long as it's compliant to one of Microsoft/IBM RIFF/Wave, Sparc AU, Cre‐
       ative Tech. voice formats. If nothing detected, -r , -c and -f should be given, or -f should be given with special format.

           $ axfer transfer playback -r 22050 -c 1 -f S16_LE -t raw something

       The above will transfer audio data frame in 'something' file including no information of sample format, as sample format  of
       22050  Hz, monaural, signed 16 bit little endian PCM for playback. The transmission continues till catching SIGINT from key‐
       board or SIGTERM by kill(1) .

           $ axfer transfer capture -d 10 -f cd something.wav

       The above will transfer audio data frame to 'something.wav' file as sample format of 44.1 kHz, 2  channels,  signed  16  bit
       little endian PCM, during 10 seconds. The file format is Microsoft/IBM RIFF/Wave according to suffix of the given filepath .

           $ axfer transfer capture -s 1024 -r 48000 -c 2 -f S32_BE -I -t au channels

       The  above  will  transfer audio data frame as sample format of 48.0 kHz, 2 channels, signed 32 bit big endian PCM for 1,024
       number of data frames to files named 'channels-1.au' and 'channels-2.au'.

SCHEDULING MODEL
       In a design of ALSA PCM core, runtime of PCM substream supports two modes; period-wakeup and  no-period-wakeup.   These  two
       modes are for different scheduling models.

   IRQ-based scheduling model
       As a default, period-wakeup mode is used. In this mode, in-kernel drivers should operate hardware to generate periodical no‐
       tification for transmission of audio data frame. The interval of notification is equivalent to the same amount of audio data
       frame as one period of buffer, against actual time.

       In  a  handler  assigned  to  the notification, a helper function of ALSA PCM core is called to update a position to head of
       hardware transmission, then compare it with a position to head of application operation to judge overrun/underrun (XRUN) and
       to wake up blocked processes.

       For  this  purpose,  hardware IRQ of controller for serial audio bus such as Inter-IC sound is typically used. In this case,
       the controller generates the IRQ according to transmission on the serial audio bus. In the handler assigned to the IRQ,  di‐
       rect media access (DMA) transmission is requested between dedicated host memory and device memory.

       If target hardware doesn't support this kind of mechanism, the periodical notification should be emulated by any timer; e.g.
       hrtimer, kernel timer.  External PCM plugins generated by PCM plugin SDK in alsa-lib should also emulate  the  above  behav‐
       iour.

       In this mode, PCM applications are programmed according to typical way of I/O operations. They execute blocking system calls
       to read/write audio data frame in buffer of PCM substream, or blocking system calls to wait until any audio  data  frame  is
       available. In axfer , this is called IRQ-based scheduling model and a default behaviour. Users can explicitly configure this
       mode by usage of --sched-model option with irq value.

   Timer-based scheduling model
       The no-period-wakeup mode is an optional mode of runtime of PCM substream. The mode assumes a specific feature  of  hardware
       and  assist of in-kernel driver and PCM applications. In this mode, in-kernel drivers don't operate hardware to generate pe‐
       riodical notification for transmission of audio data frame.  The hardware should automatically continue transmission of  au‐
       dio  data  frame  without periodical operation of the drivers; e.g. according to auto-triggered DMA transmission, a chain of
       registered descriptors.

       In this mode, nothing wakes up blocked processes, therefore PCM applications should be programmed without any blocking oper‐
       ation. For this reason, this mode is enabled when the PCM applications explicitly configure hardware parameter to runtime of
       PCM substream, to prevent disorder of existing applications.  Additionally, nothing maintains timing for transmission of au‐
       dio  data  frame,  therefore the PCM applications should voluntarily handle any timer to queue audio data frame in buffer of
       the PCM substream for lapse of time. Furthermore, instead of driver, the PCM application should call a  helper  function  of
       ALSA PCM core to update a position to head of hardware transmission and to check XRUN.

       In  axfer  ,  this  is called timer-based scheduling model and available as long as hardware/driver assists no-period-wakeup
       runtime. Users should explicitly set this mode by usage of --sched-model option with timer value.

       In the scheduling model, PCM applications need to care of available space on PCM buffer  by  lapse  of  time,  typically  by
       yielding  CPU  and  wait  for  rescheduling.  For the yielding, timeout is calculated for preferable amount of PCM frames to
       process. This is convenient to a kind of applications, like sound servers. when an I/O thread of the  server  wait  for  the
       timeout,  the  other threads can process audio data frames for server clients. Furthermore, with usage of rewinding/forward‐
       ing, applications can achieve low latency between transmission position and handling position even if they uses  large  size
       of PCM buffers.

   Advantages and issues
       Ideally,  timer-based  scheduling  model has some advantages than IRQ-based scheduling model. At first, no interrupt context
       runs for PCM substream. The PCM substream is handled in any process context only. No need to care of race conditions between
       IRQ and process contexts. This reduces some concerns for some developers of drivers and applications. Secondary, CPU time is
       not used for handlers on the interrupt context. The CPU time can be dedicated for the other tasks. This is good in  a  point
       of  Time Sharing System. Thirdly, hardware is not configured to generate interrupts. This is good in a point of reduction of
       overall power consumption possibly.

       In either scheduling model, the hardware should allow drivers to read the number of audio data frame transferred between the
       dedicated  memory and the device memory for audio serial bus. However, in timer-based scheduling model, fine granularity and
       accuracy of the value is important. Actually hardware performs transmission between dedicated memory and device memory for a
       small  batch  of  audio  data frames or bytes. In a view of PCM applications, the granularity in current transmission is re‐
       quired to decide correct timeout for each I/O operation.  As  of  Linux  kernel  v4.21,  ALSA  PCM  interface  between  ker‐
       nel/userspace has no feature to report it.

COMPATIBILITY TO APLAY
       The  transfer subcommand of axfer is designed to keep compatibility to aplay(1). However some options below are not compati‐
       ble due to several technical reasons.

       -I, --separate-channels
              This option is supported just for files to store audio data frames corresponding to each channel. In aplay(1)  imple‐
              mentation, this option has an additional effect to use PCM buffer aligned to non-interleaved order if a target device
              supports. As of 2018, PCM buffer of non-interleaved order is hardly used by sound devices.

       -A, --avail-min=#
              This option indicates threshold to wake up blocked process in a unit of audio data frame. Against aplay(1)  implemen‐
              tation, this option has no effect with --mmap option as well as timer of --sched-model option.

       -R, --start-delay=#
              This  option  indicates threshold to start prepared PCM substream in a unit of audio data frame. Against aplay(1) im‐
              plementation, this option has no effect with --mmap option as well as timer of --sched-model option.

       -T, --stop-delay=#
              This option indicates threshold to stop running PCM substream in a unit of audio data frame. Against aplay(1)  imple‐
              mentation, this option has no effect with --mmap option as well as timer of --sched-model option.

       --max-file-time=#
              This  option  is  unsupported.  In aplay(1) implementation, the option has an effect for capture transmission to save
              files up to the same number of data frames as the given value by second unit, or the maximum number  of  data  frames
              supported  by used file format. When reaching to the limitation, used file is closed, then new file is opened and au‐
              dio data frames are written. However, this option requires extra handling of files and shall increase  complexity  of
              main loop of axfer.

       --use-strftime=FORMAT
              This option is unsupported. In aplay(1) implementation, the option has an effect for capture transmission to generate
              file paths according to given format in which some extra formats are available as well as formats supported by  strf‐
              time(3).  However,  this  option  requires extra string processing for file paths and it's bothersome if written in C
              language.

       --process-id-file=FILEPATH
              This option is unsupported. In aplay(1) implementation, the option has an effect to create a file for given value and
              write  out  process  ID  to  it. This file allows users to get process ID and send any POSIX signal to aplay process.
              However, this idea has some troubles for file locking when multiple aplay processes run with the same file.

       -V, --vumeter=TYPE
              This option is not supported at present. In aplay(1) implementation, this option has an effect to occupy stdout  with
              some  terminal  control  characters and display vumeter for monaural and stereo channels. However, some problems lay;
              this feature is just for audio data frames with PCM format, this feature brings disorder of terminal after  aborting,
              stdout is not available for pipeline.

       -i, --interactive
              This  option  is  not supported at present. In aplay(1) implementation, this option has an effect to occupy stdin for
              key input and suspend/resume PCM substream according to pushed enter key. However, this  feature  requires  an  addi‐
              tional input handling in main loop and leave bothersome operation to maintain PCM substream.

       -m, --chmap=CH1,CH2,...
              ALSA  PCM  core  and control core doesn't support this feature, therefore remapping should be done in userspace. This
              brings overhead to align audio data frames, especially for mmap operation. Furthermore, as of alsa-lib  v1.1.8,  some
              plugins  don't support this feature expectedly, thus this option is a lack of transparent operation. At present, this
              option is not supported yet not to confuse users.

       SIGTSTP, SIGCONT
              This performs suspend/resume of PCM substream. In aplay(1) implementation, these operations bring XRUN state  to  the
              substream,  and  suspend/resume is done in interactive mode in the above. Some developers use the signal for recovery
              test from XRUN. At present, no alternative is supported for the test.

       SIGUSR1
              This is not supported. In aplay(1) implementation, this signal is assigned to a handler to close a  current  file  to
              store  audio  data frame and open a new file to continue processing. However, as well as --max-file-time option, this
              option should increase complexity of main loop of axfer.

DESIGN
   Modular structure
       This program consists of three modules; xfer , mapper and container .  Each module has an abstraction layer to enable actual
       implementation.

                  --------     ----------     -------------
       device &lt;-&gt; | xfer | &lt;-&gt; | mapper | &lt;-&gt; | container | &lt;-&gt; file
                  --------     ----------     -------------
                   libasound    single         wav
                   libffado     multiple       au
                                               voc
                                               raw

       The  xfer  module performs actual transmission to devices and nodes. The module can have several transmission backends. As a
       default backend, libasound backend is used to perform transmission via alsa-lib APIs. The  module  allows  each  backend  to
       parse own command line options.

       The  container  module performs to read/write audio data frame via descriptor for file/stream of multimedia container or raw
       data. The module automatically detect type of multimedia container and parse parameters in its metadata of data  header.  At
       present,  three  types of multimedia containers are supported; Microsoft/IBM RIFF/Wave ( wav ), Sparc AU ( au ) and Creative
       Technology voice ( voc ). Additionally, a special container is prepared for raw audio data ( raw ).

       The mapper module handles buffer layout and alignment for transmission of audio data frame.  The module has two  implementa‐
       tions;  single and multiple .  The single backend uses one container to construct the buffer. The multiple backend uses sev‐
       eral containers to construct it.

   Care of copying audio data frame
       Between the xfer module and mapper module, a pointer to buffer including audio data frames is passed. This  buffer  has  two
       shapes  for  interleaved  and  non-interleaved  order. For the former, the pointer points to one buffer. For the latter, the
       pointer points to an array in which each element points to one buffer. Between the mapper module  and  container  module,  a
       pointer to one buffer is passed because supported media containers including raw type store audio data frames in interleaved
       order.

       In passing audio data frame between the modules, axfer is programmed to avoid copying between a buffer to another buffer  as
       much as possible. For example, in some scenarios below, no copying occurs between modules.

        - xfer(mmap/interleaved), mapper(single), container(any)
        - xfer(mmap/non-interleaved), mapper(multiple), containers(any)

   Unit test
       For each of the mapper and container module, unit test is available. To run the tests, execute below command:

       $ make test

       Each test iterates writing to file and reading to the file for many times and it takes long time to finish. Please take care
       of the execution time if running on any CI environment.
