NAME
       Dpkg::BuildFlags - query build flags

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used by dpkg-buildflags and can be used to query the same information.

METHODS
       $bf = Dpkg::BuildFlags-&gt;new()
           Create a new Dpkg::BuildFlags object. It will be initialized based on the value of several configuration files and
           environment variables.

           If the option vendor_defaults is set to false, then no vendor defaults are initialized (it defaults to true).

       $bf-&gt;load_vendor_defaults()
           Reset the flags stored to the default set provided by the vendor.

       $bf-&gt;load_system_config()
           Update flags from the system configuration.

       $bf-&gt;load_user_config()
           Update flags from the user configuration.

       $bf-&gt;load_environment_config()
           Update flags based on user directives stored in the environment. See dpkg-buildflags(1) for details.

       $bf-&gt;load_maintainer_config()
           Update flags based on maintainer directives stored in the environment. See dpkg-buildflags(1) for details.

       $bf-&gt;load_config()
           Call successively load_system_config(), load_user_config(), load_environment_config() and load_maintainer_config() to
           update the default build flags defined by the vendor.

       $bf-&gt;unset($flag)
           Unset the build flag $flag, so that it will not be known anymore.

       $bf-&gt;set($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Update the build flag $flag with value $value and record its origin as $source (if defined). Record it as maintainer
           modified if $maint is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;set_feature($area, $feature, $enabled)
           Update the boolean state of whether a specific feature within a known feature area has been enabled. The only currently
           known feature areas are "future", "qa", "sanitize", "optimize", "hardening" and "reproducible".

       $bf-&gt;get_feature($area, $feature)
           Returns the value for the given feature within a known feature area.  This is relevant for builtin features where the
           feature has a ternary state of true, false and undef, and where the latter cannot be retrieved with use_feature().

       $bf-&gt;use_feature($area, $feature)
           Returns true if the given feature within a known feature areas has been enabled, and false otherwise.  The only
           currently recognized feature areas are "future", "qa", "sanitize", "optimize", "hardening" and "reproducible".

       $bf-&gt;set_builtin($area, $feature, $enabled)
           Update the boolean state of whether a specific feature within a known feature area is handled (even if only in some
           architectures) as a builtin default by the compiler.

       $bf-&gt;get_builtins($area)
           Return, for the given area, a hash with keys as feature names, and values as booleans indicating whether the feature is
           handled as a builtin default by the compiler or not. Only features that might be handled as builtins on some
           architectures are returned as part of the hash. Missing features mean they are currently never handled as builtins by
           the compiler.

       $bf-&gt;set_option_value($option, $value)
           Private method to set the value of a build option.  Do not use outside of the dpkg project.

       $bf-&gt;get_option_value($option)
           Private method to get the value of a build option.  Do not use outside of the dpkg project.

       $bf-&gt;strip($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Update the build flag $flag by stripping the flags listed in $value and record its origin as $source (if defined).
           Record it as maintainer modified if $maint is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;append($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Append the options listed in $value to the current value of the flag $flag.  Record its origin as $source (if defined).
           Record it as maintainer modified if $maint is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;prepend($flag, $value, $source, $maint)
           Prepend the options listed in $value to the current value of the flag $flag.  Record its origin as $source (if defined).
           Record it as maintainer modified if $maint is defined and true.

       $bf-&gt;update_from_conffile($file, $source)
           Update the current build flags based on the configuration directives contained in $file. See dpkg-buildflags(1) for the
           format of the directives.

           $source is the origin recorded for any build flag set or modified.

       $bf-&gt;get($flag)
           Return the value associated to the flag. It might be undef if the flag doesn't exist.

       $bf-&gt;get_feature_areas()
           Return the feature areas (i.e. the area values has_features will return true for).

       $bf-&gt;get_features($area)
           Return, for the given area, a hash with keys as feature names, and values as booleans indicating whether the feature is
           enabled or not.

       $bf-&gt;get_origin($flag)
           Return the origin associated to the flag. It might be undef if the flag doesn't exist.

       $bf-&gt;is_maintainer_modified($flag)
           Return true if the flag is modified by the maintainer.

       $bf-&gt;has_features($area)
           Returns true if the given area of features is known, and false otherwise.  The only currently recognized feature areas
           are "future", "qa", "sanitize", "optimize", "hardening" and "reproducible".

       $bf-&gt;has($option)
           Returns a boolean indicating whether the flags exists in the object.

       @flags = $bf-&gt;list()
           Returns the list of flags stored in the object.
