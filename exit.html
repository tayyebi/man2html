<pre>exit(3)                                               Library Functions Manual                                              exit(3)

NAME
       exit - cause normal process termination

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       [[noreturn]] void exit(int status);

DESCRIPTION
       The  exit() function causes normal process termination and the least significant byte of status (i.e., status &amp; 0xFF) is re‐
       turned to the parent (see wait(2)).

       All functions registered with atexit(3) and on_exit(3) are called, in the reverse order of their registration.  (It is  pos‐
       sible  for  one  of  these functions to use atexit(3) or on_exit(3) to register an additional function to be executed during
       exit processing; the new registration is added to the front of the list of functions that remain to be called.)  If  one  of
       these  functions  does not return (e.g., it calls _exit(2), or kills itself with a signal), then none of the remaining func‐
       tions is called, and further exit processing (in particular, flushing of stdio(3) streams) is abandoned.  If a function  has
       been registered multiple times using atexit(3) or on_exit(3), then it is called as many times as it was registered.

       All open stdio(3) streams are flushed and closed.  Files created by tmpfile(3) are removed.

       The  C  standard specifies two constants, EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE, that may be passed to exit() to indicate successful
       or unsuccessful termination, respectively.

RETURN VALUE
       The exit() function does not return.

       For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see attributes(7).

       └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────────────┘

       The exit() function uses a global variable that is not protected, so it is not thread-safe.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99, SVr4, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
       The behavior is undefined if one of the  functions  registered  using  atexit(3)  and  on_exit(3)  calls  either  exit()  or
       longjmp(3).  Note that a call to execve(2) removes registrations created using atexit(3) and on_exit(3).

       The  use  of  EXIT_SUCCESS  and EXIT_FAILURE is slightly more portable (to non-UNIX environments) than the use of 0 and some
       nonzero value like 1 or -1.  In particular, VMS uses a different convention.

       BSD has attempted to standardize exit codes (which some C libraries such as the GNU C library have also  adopted);  see  the
       file &lt;sysexits.h&gt;.

       After exit(), the exit status must be transmitted to the parent process.  There are three cases:

       •  If the parent has set SA_NOCLDWAIT, or has set the SIGCHLD handler to SIG_IGN, the status is discarded and the child dies
          immediately.

       •  If the parent was waiting on the child, it is notified of the exit status and the child dies immediately.

       •  Otherwise, the child becomes a "zombie" process: most of the process resources are recycled, but a slot containing  mini‐
          mal  information  about  the  child process (termination status, resource usage statistics) is retained in process table.
          This allows the parent to subsequently use waitpid(2) (or similar) to learn the termination status of the child; at  that
          point the zombie process slot is released.

       If  the  implementation supports the SIGCHLD signal, this signal is sent to the parent.  If the parent has set SA_NOCLDWAIT,
       it is undefined whether a SIGCHLD signal is sent.

   Signals sent to other processes
       If the exiting process is a session leader and its controlling terminal is the controlling terminal  of  the  session,  then
       each  process in the foreground process group of this controlling terminal is sent a SIGHUP signal, and the terminal is dis‐
       associated from this session, allowing it to be acquired by a new controlling process.

       If the exit of the process causes a process group to become orphaned, and if any member of the newly orphaned process  group
       is  stopped,  then  a  SIGHUP  signal  followed by a SIGCONT signal will be sent to each process in this process group.  See
       setpgid(2) for an explanation of orphaned process groups.

       Except in the above cases, where the signalled processes may be children  of  the  terminating  process,  termination  of  a
       process  does not in general cause a signal to be sent to children of that process.  However, a process can use the prctl(2)
       PR_SET_PDEATHSIG operation to arrange that it receives a signal if its parent terminates.
