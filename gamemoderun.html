NAME
       gamemoderun - invoke gamemode into any program

SYNOPSIS
       gamemoderun PROGRAM

DESCRIPTION
       GameMode  is  a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set of optimisations be temporarily applied to the
       host OS.

       The design has a clear cut abstraction between the host daemon and library (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client load‐
       ers  (libgamemodeauto  and  gamemode_client.h)  that  allows for safe usage without worrying about whether the daemon is in‐
       stalled or running. This design also means that while the host library currently relies on systemd for  exchanging  messages
       with the daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work with the same clients.

       GameMode  was  designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand gover‐
       nors, but is intended to be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of automation  tasks  one  might
       want to apply.

USAGE
       libgamemodeauto.so.0 can be pre-loaded into any program to request gamemoded begin or end the mode, like so:

           gamemoderun ./game

       Or by setting the Steam launch options for a game:

           gamemoderun %command%

       The library can be manually preloaded if needed:

           LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/\$LIB/libgamemodeauto.so.0 ./game

CONFIG
       It is possible to set additional start commands to gamemoderun by setting the environment variable:

           GAMEMODERUNEXEC="command"

       When  this  is  set, gamemoderun will execute the command given by that environment variable, and the command line passed to
       gamemoderun will be passed as arguments to that command. GameMode will not be applied to the wrapper command, just the  game
       itself.
