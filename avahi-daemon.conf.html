NAME
       avahi-daemon.conf - avahi-daemon configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf

DESCRIPTION
       avahi-daemon.conf is the configuration file for avahi-daemon.

SECTION [SERVER]
       host-name=  Set  the  host name avahi-daemon tries to register on the LAN. If omited defaults to the system host name as set
       with the sethostname() system call.

       host-name-from-machine-id= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will use  the  machine-id  as
       name on the LAN.

       domain-name= Set the default domain name avahi-daemon tries to register its host name and services on the LAN in. If omitted
       defaults to ".local".

       browse-domains= Set a comma separated list of browsing domains (in addition to the default one and  those  announced  inside
       the  default  browsing domain). Please note that the user may specify additional browsing domains on the client side, either
       by setting $AVAHI_BROWSE_DOMAINS to a list of colon separated domains or by adding them  to  the  XDG  config  file  ~/.con‐
       fig/avahi/browse-domains (separated by newlines).

       use-ipv4= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "no" avahi-daemon will not use IPv4 sockets. Default is "yes".

       use-ipv6= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "no" avahi-daemon will not use IPv6 sockets. Default is "yes".

       allow-interfaces=  Set a comma separated list of allowed network interfaces that should be used by the avahi-daemon. Traffic
       on other interfaces will be ignored. If set to an empty list all local interfaces except loopback and point-to-point will be
       used.

       deny-interfaces=  Set  a comma separated list of network interfaces that should be ignored by avahi-daemon. Other not speci‐
       fied interfaces will be used, unless allow-interfaces= is set. This option takes precedence over allow-interfaces=.

       check-response-ttl= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes", an additional security check is  activated:  in‐
       coming IP packets will be ignored unless the IP TTL is 255. Earlier mDNS specifications required this check. Since this fea‐
       ture may be incompatible with newer implementations of mDNS it defaults to "no". On the other hand it provides  extra  secu‐
       rity.

       use-iff-running= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon monitors the IFF_RUNNING flag bit which
       is used by some (modern) network drivers to tell user space if a network cable is plugged in (in case of  copper  ethernet),
       or the network card is associated with some kind of network (in case of WLAN). If IFF_RUNNING is set avahi-daemon will auto‐
       matically announce its services on that network. Unfortunately far too many network drivers do not support this flag or sup‐
       port it in a broken way. Therefore this option defaults to "no".

       enable-dbus= Takes either "yes", "no" or "warn". If set to "yes" avahi-daemon connects to D-Bus, offering an object oriented
       client API. It is only available if Avahi has been compiled with --enable-dbus in which case it defaults  to  "yes".  "warn"
       behaves like "yes", but the daemon starts up even when it fails to connect to a D-Bus daemon. In addition, if the connection
       to the D-Bus daemon is terminated we try to reconnect. (Unless we are in a chroot() environment where this  definitely  will
       fail.)

       disallow-other-stacks=  Takes  a  boolean  value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" no other process is allowed to bind to UDP
       port 5353. This effectively impedes other mDNS stacks from running on the host. Use this as a security measure to make  sure
       that  only  Avahi  is responsible for mDNS traffic. Please note that we do not recommend running multiple mDNS stacks on the
       same host simultaneously. This hampers reliability and is a waste of resources. However, to not annoy people this option de‐
       faults to "no".

       allow-point-to-point=  Takes  a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will make use of interfaces with
       the POINTOPOINT flag set. This option defaults to "no" as it might make mDNS unreliable due to usually large latencies  with
       such links and opens a potential security hole by allowing mDNS access from Internet connections. Use with care and YMMV!

       cache-entries-max=  Takes  an  unsigned integer specifying how many resource records are cached per interface. Bigger values
       allow mDNS work correctly in large LANs but also increase memory consumption.

       clients-max= Takes an unsigned integer. The maximum number of concurrent D-Bus clients allowed. If  the  maximum  number  is
       reached further clients will be refused until at least one existing client disconnects.

       objects-per-client-max=  Takes  an  unsigned integer. The maximum number of objects (entry groups, browsers, resolvers) that
       may be registered per D-Bus client at a time. If the maximum number is reached further object creation will be refused until
       at least one object is freed.

       entries-per-entry-group-max=  Takes  an  unsigned  integer. The maximum number of entries (resource records) per entry group
       registered by a D-Bus client at a time. If the maximum number is reached further resource records may not be added to an en‐
       try group.

       ratelimit-interval-usec= Takes an unsigned integer. Sets the per-interface packet rate-limiting interval parameter. Together
       with ratelimit-burst= this may be used to control the maximum number of packets Avahi will generated in a specific period of
       time on an interface.

       ratelimit-burst= Takes an unsigned integer. Sets the per-interface packet rate-limiting burst parameter. Together with rate‐
       limit-interval-usec= this may be used to control the maximum number of packets Avahi will generated in a specific period  of
       time on an interface.

SECTION [WIDE-AREA]
       enable-wide-area=  Takes  a  boolean value ("yes" or "no"). Enable wide-area DNS-SD, aka DNS-SD over unicast DNS. If this is
       enabled only domains ending in .local will be resolved on mDNS, all other domains are resolved via unicast DNS. If you  want
       to  maintain  multiple  different  multicast DNS domains even with this option enabled we encourage you to use subdomains of
       .local, such as "kitchen.local". This option defaults to "yes".

SECTION [PUBLISH]
       disable-publishing= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes", no record will be published by Avahi,  not  even
       address  records for the local host. Avahi will be started in a querying-only mode. Use this is a security measure. This op‐
       tion defaults to "no"

       disable-user-service-publishing= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes", Avahi will  still  publish  address
       records  and  suchlike but will not allow user applications to publish services. Use this is a security measure. This option
       defaults to "no"

       add-service-cookie= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" an implicit TXT entry will be added  to  all  lo‐
       cally  registered services, containing a cookie value which is chosen randomly on daemon startup. This can be used to detect
       if two services on two different interfaces/protocols are actually identical. Defaults to "no".

       publish-addresses= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will register  mDNS  address  records
       for all local IP addresses. Unless you want to use avahi-daemon exclusively for browsing it's recommended to enable this. If
       you plan to register local services you need to enable this option. Defaults to "yes".

       publish-hinfo= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will register an mDNS HINFO record on all
       interfaces  which  contains  information  about the local operating system and CPU, which might be useful for administrative
       purposes. This is recommended by the mDNS specification but not required. For the sake of privacy you might choose  to  dis‐
       able this feature. Defaults to "no".

       publish-workstation=  Takes  a  boolean  value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will register a service of type
       "_workstation._tcp" on the local LAN. This might be useful for administrative purposes (i.e. browse for all PCs on the LAN),
       but is not required or recommended by any specification. Newer MacOS X releases register a service of this type. Defaults to
       "no".

       publish-domain= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will announce the  locally  used  domain
       name (see above) for browsing by other hosts. Defaults to "yes".

       publish-dns-servers= Takes a comma separated list of IP addresses for unicast DNS servers. You can use this to announce uni‐
       cast DNS servers via mDNS. When used in conjunction with avahi-dnsconfd on the client side this allows DHCP-like  configura‐
       tion of unicast DNS servers.

       publish-resolv-conf-dns-servers=  Takes  a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will publish the uni‐
       cast DNS servers specified in /etc/resolv.conf in addition to those specified with publish-dns-servers. Send avahi-daemon  a
       SIGHUP to have it reload this file. Defaults to "no".

       publish-aaaa-on-ipv4=  Takes  a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will publish an IPv6 AAAA record
       via IPv4, i.e. the local IPv6 addresses can be resolved using an IPv4 transport. Only useful when IPv4 is enabled with  use-
       ipv4=true. Defaults to "yes".

       publish-a-on-ipv6=  Takes  a  boolean  value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will publish an IPv4 A record via
       IPv6, i.e. the local IPv4 addresses can be resolved using an IPv6 transport. Only useful when  IPv6  is  enabled  with  use-
       ipv6=true. Defaults to "no".

SECTION [REFLECTOR]
       enable-reflector= Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" avahi-daemon will reflect incoming mDNS requests to
       all local network interfaces, effectively allowing clients to browse mDNS/DNS-SD services on all networks connected  to  the
       gateway.  The  gateway  is somewhat intelligent and should work with all kinds of mDNS traffic, though some functionality is
       lost (specifically the unicast reply bit, which is used rarely anyway). Make sure to not run multiple reflectors between the
       same networks, this might cause them to play Ping Pong with mDNS packets. Defaults to "no".

       reflect-ipv=  Takes a boolean value ("yes" or "no"). If set to "yes" and enable-reflector is enabled, avahi-daemon will for‐
       ward mDNS traffic between IPv4 and IPv6, which is usually not recommended. Defaults to "no".

       reflect-filters= Set a comma separated list of allowed service names to be reflected. Each service that is seen  must  match
       an  entry in this list to be reflected to other networks. This list can match the type of service or the name of the machine
       providing the service. Defaults to allowing all services.

SECTION [RLIMITS]
       This section is used to define system resource limits for the daemon. See setrlimit(2) for more information. If any  of  the
       options is not specified in the configuration file, avahi-daemon does not change it from the system defaults.

       rlimit-as=  Value  in bytes for RLIMIT_AS (maximum size of the process's virtual memory). Sensible values are heavily system
       dependent.

       rlimit-core= Value in bytes for RLIMIT_CORE (maximum core file size). Unless you want to debug avahi-daemon, it is  safe  to
       set this to 0.

       rlimit-data= Value in bytes for RLIMIT_DATA (maximum size of the process's data segment). Sensible values are heavily system
       dependent.

       rlimit-fsize= Value for RLIMIT_FSIZE (maximum size of files the process may create). Since avahi-daemon shouldn't write  any
       files to disk, it is safe to set this to 0.

       rlimit-nofile= Value for RLIMIT_NOFILE (open file descriptors). avahi-daemon shouldn't need more than 15 to 20 open file de‐
       scriptors concurrently.

       rlimit-stack= Value in bytes for RLIMIT_STACK (maximum size of the process stack). Sensible values are heavily system depen‐
       dent.

       rlimit-nproc=  Value for RLIMIT_NPROC (max number of processes a user can launch). avahi-daemon forks of a helper process on
       systems where chroot(2) is available therefore this value should not be set below 2. Note that while the process limit  only
       applies to this process, the total count of processes to reach that limit includes all processes on the system with the same
       UID, including any containers without UID remapping (such as lxd containers with security.privileged=true). The default con‐
       figuration of 3 was removed to prevent problems in this scenario.
