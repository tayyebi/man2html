<pre>GIT-CHECKOUT-INDEX(1)                                        Git Manual                                       GIT-CHECKOUT-INDEX(1)

NAME
       git-checkout-index - Copy files from the index to the working tree

SYNOPSIS
       git checkout-index [-u] [-q] [-a] [-f] [-n] [--prefix=&lt;string&gt;]
                          [--stage=&lt;number&gt;|all]
                          [--temp]
                          [--ignore-skip-worktree-bits]
                          [-z] [--stdin]
                          [--] [&lt;file&gt;...]

DESCRIPTION
       Will copy all files listed from the index to the working directory (not overwriting existing files).

OPTIONS
       -u, --index
           update stat information for the checked out entries in the index file.

       -q, --quiet
           be quiet if files exist or are not in the index

       -f, --force
           forces overwrite of existing files

       -a, --all
           checks out all files in the index except for those with the skip-worktree bit set (see --ignore-skip-worktree-bits).
           Cannot be used together with explicit filenames.

       -n, --no-create
           Donâ€™t checkout new files, only refresh files already checked out.

       --prefix=&lt;string&gt;
           When creating files, prepend &lt;string&gt; (usually a directory including a trailing /)

       --stage=&lt;number&gt;|all
           Instead of checking out unmerged entries, copy out the files from named stage. &lt;number&gt; must be between 1 and 3. Note:
           --stage=all automatically implies --temp.

       --temp
           Instead of copying the files to the working directory write the content to temporary files. The temporary name
           associations will be written to stdout.

       --ignore-skip-worktree-bits
           Check out all files, including those with the skip-worktree bit set.

       --stdin
           Instead of taking list of paths from the command line, read list of paths from the standard input. Paths are separated
           by LF (i.e. one path per line) by default.

       -z
           Only meaningful with --stdin; paths are separated with NUL character instead of LF.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       The order of the flags used to matter, but not anymore.

       Just doing git checkout-index does nothing. You probably meant git checkout-index -a. And if you want to force it, you want
       git checkout-index -f -a.

       Intuitiveness is not the goal here. Repeatability is. The reason for the "no arguments means no work" behavior is that from
       scripts you are supposed to be able to do:

           $ find . -name '*.h' -print0 | xargs -0 git checkout-index -f --

       which will force all existing *.h files to be replaced with their cached copies. If an empty command line implied "all",
       then this would force-refresh everything in the index, which was not the point. But since git checkout-index accepts --stdin
       it would be faster to use:

           $ find . -name '*.h' -print0 | git checkout-index -f -z --stdin

       The -- is just a good idea when you know the rest will be filenames; it will prevent problems with a filename of, for
       example, -a. Using -- is probably a good policy in scripts.

USING --TEMP OR --STAGE=ALL
       When --temp is used (or implied by --stage=all) git checkout-index will create a temporary file for each index entry being
       checked out. The index will not be updated with stat information. These options can be useful if the caller needs all stages
       of all unmerged entries so that the unmerged files can be processed by an external merge tool.

       A listing will be written to stdout providing the association of temporary file names to tracked path names. The listing
       format has two variations:

        1. tempname TAB path RS

           The first format is what gets used when --stage is omitted or is not --stage=all. The field tempname is the temporary
           file name holding the file content and path is the tracked path name in the index. Only the requested entries are
           output.

        2. stage1temp SP stage2temp SP stage3tmp TAB path RS

           The second format is what gets used when --stage=all. The three stage temporary fields (stage1temp, stage2temp,
           stage3temp) list the name of the temporary file if there is a stage entry in the index or .  if there is no stage entry.
           Paths which only have a stage 0 entry will always be omitted from the output.

       In both formats RS (the record separator) is newline by default but will be the null byte if -z was passed on the command
       line. The temporary file names are always safe strings; they will never contain directory separators or whitespace
       characters. The path field is always relative to the current directory and the temporary file names are always relative to
       the top level directory.

       If the object being copied out to a temporary file is a symbolic link the content of the link will be written to a normal
       file. It is up to the end-user or the Porcelain to make use of this information.

EXAMPLES
       To update and refresh only the files already checked out

               $ git checkout-index -n -f -a &amp;&amp; git update-index --ignore-missing --refresh

       Using git checkout-index to "export an entire tree"
           The prefix ability basically makes it trivial to use git checkout-index as an "export as tree" function. Just read the
           desired tree into the index, and do:

               $ git checkout-index --prefix=git-export-dir/ -a

           git checkout-index will "export" the index into the specified directory.

           The final "/" is important. The exported name is literally just prefixed with the specified string. Contrast this with
           the following example.

       Export files with a prefix

               $ git checkout-index --prefix=.merged- Makefile

           This will check out the currently cached copy of Makefile into the file .merged-Makefile.
