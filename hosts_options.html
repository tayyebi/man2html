NAME
       hosts_options - host access control language extensions

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes extensions to the language described in the hosts_access(5) document.

       The extensible language uses the following format:

          daemon_list : client_list : option : option ...

       The first two fields are described in the hosts_access(5) manual page.  The remainder of the rules is a list of zero or more
       options.  Any ":" characters within options should be protected with a backslash.

       An option is of the form "keyword" or "keyword value". Options are processed in the specified order. Some options  are  sub‐
       jected  to  %&lt;letter&gt;  substitutions. For the sake of backwards compatibility with earlier versions, an "=" is permitted be‐
       tween keyword and value.

LOGGING
       severity mail.info

       severity notice
              Change the severity level at which the event will be logged. Facility names (such as mail) are optional, and are  not
              supported  on  systems  with  older syslog implementations. The severity option can be used to emphasize or to ignore
              specific events.

ACCESS CONTROL
       allow

       deny   Grant (deny) service. These options must appear at the end of a rule.

       The allow and deny keywords make it possible to keep all access control rules within a  single  file,  for  example  in  the
       hosts.allow file.

       To permit access from specific hosts only:

          ALL: .friendly.domain: ALLOW
          ALL: ALL: DENY

       To permit access from all hosts except a few trouble makers:

          ALL: .bad.domain: DENY
          ALL: ALL: ALLOW

       Notice the leading dot on the domain name patterns.

RUNNING OTHER COMMANDS
       aclexec shell_command
              Execute,  in a child process, the specified shell command, after performing the %&lt;letter&gt; expansions described in the
              hosts_access(5) manual page.  The command is executed with stdin, stdout and stderr connected to the null device,  so
              that it won't mess up the conversation with the client host. Example:

                 smtp : ALL : aclexec checkdnsbl %a

              executes,  in  a background child process, the shell command "checkdnsbl %a" after replacing %a by the address of the
              remote host.

              The connection will be allowed or refused depending on whether the command returns a true or false exit status.

       spawn shell_command
              Execute, in a child process, the specified shell command, after performing the %&lt;letter&gt; expansions described in  the
              hosts_access(5)  manual page.  The command is executed with stdin, stdout and stderr connected to the null device, so
              that it won't mess up the conversation with the client host. Example:

                 spawn (/usr/sbin/safe_finger -l @%h | /usr/bin/mail root) &amp;

              executes, in a background child process, the shell command "safe_finger -l @%h | mail root" after replacing %h by the
              name or address of the remote host.

              The  example  uses  the  "safe_finger" command instead of the regular "finger" command, to limit possible damage from
              data sent by the finger server. The "safe_finger" command is part of the daemon wrapper  package;  it  is  a  wrapper
              around the regular finger command that filters the data sent by the remote host.

       twist shell_command
              Replace  the current process by an instance of the specified shell command, after performing the %&lt;letter&gt; expansions
              described in the hosts_access(5) manual page.  Stdin, stdout and stderr are connected to the client process. This op‐
              tion must appear at the end of a rule.

              To send a customized bounce message to the client instead of running the real ftp daemon:

                 in.ftpd : ... : twist /bin/echo 421 Some bounce message

              For an alternative way to talk to client processes, see the banners option below.

              To run /some/other/in.telnetd without polluting its command-line array or its process environment:

                 in.telnetd : ... : twist PATH=/some/other; exec in.telnetd

              Warning:   in  case  of UDP services, do not twist to commands that use the standard I/O or the read(2)/write(2) rou‐
              tines to communicate with the client process; UDP requires other I/O primitives.

NETWORK OPTIONS
       keepalive
              Causes the server to periodically send a message to the client.  The connection is considered broken when the  client
              does not respond. The keepalive option can be useful when users turn off their machine while it is still connected to
              a server.  The keepalive option is not useful for datagram (UDP) services.

       linger number_of_seconds
              Specifies how long the kernel will try to deliver not-yet delivered data after the server process  closes  a  connec‐
              tion.

USERNAME LOOKUP
       rfc931 [ timeout_in_seconds ]
              Look  up  the  client user name with the RFC 931 (TAP, IDENT, RFC 1413) protocol.  This option is silently ignored in
              case of services based on transports other than TCP.  It requires that the client system  runs  an  RFC  931  (IDENT,
              etc.)  -compliant daemon, and may cause noticeable delays with connections from non-UNIX clients.  The timeout period
              is optional. If no timeout is specified a compile-time defined default value is taken.

MISCELLANEOUS
       banners /some/directory
              Look for a file in `/some/directory´ with the same name as the daemon process (for example in.telnetd for the  telnet
              service), and copy its contents to the client. Newline characters are replaced by carriage-return newline, and %&lt;let‐
              ter&gt; sequences are expanded (see the hosts_access(5) manual page).

              The tcp wrappers source code distribution provides a sample makefile (Banners.Makefile) for convenient banner mainte‐
              nance.

              Warning: banners are supported for connection-oriented (TCP) network services only.

       nice [ number ]
              Change  the  nice  value  of the process (default 10).  Specify a positive value to spend more CPU resources on other
              processes.

       setenv name value
              Place a (name, value) pair into the process environment. The value is subjected to %&lt;letter&gt; expansions and may  con‐
              tain whitespace (but leading and trailing blanks are stripped off).

              Warning: many network daemons reset their environment before spawning a login or shell process.

       umask 022
              Like  the  umask  command that is built into the shell. An umask of 022 prevents the creation of files with group and
              world write permission.  The umask argument should be an octal number.

       user nobody

       user nobody.kmem
              Assume the privileges of the "nobody" userid (or user "nobody", group "kmem"). The first form is  useful  with  inetd
              implementations  that  run all services with root privilege. The second form is useful for services that need special
              group privileges only.

DIAGNOSTICS
       When a syntax error is found in an access control rule, the error is reported to the syslog daemon; further options will  be
       ignored, and service is denied.
