<pre>GPG-PRESET-PASSPHRASE(1)                               GNU Privacy Guard 2.2                               GPG-PRESET-PASSPHRASE(1)

NAME
       gpg-preset-passphrase - Put a passphrase into gpg-agent's cache

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-preset-passphrase [options] [command] cache-id

DESCRIPTION
       The  gpg-preset-passphrase  is  a  utility to seed the internal cache of a running gpg-agent with passphrases.  It is mainly
       useful for unattended machines, where the usual pinentry tool may not be used and the passphrases for the to  be  used  keys
       are given at machine startup.

       This program works with GnuPG 2 and later.  GnuPG 1.x is not supported.

       Passphrases  set  with  this utility don't expire unless the --forget option is used to explicitly clear them from the cache
       --- or gpg-agent is either restarted or reloaded (by sending a SIGHUP to it).  Note that the maximum cache time as set  with
       --max-cache-ttl  is still honored.  It is necessary to allow this passphrase presetting by starting gpg-agent with the --al‐
       low-preset-passphrase.

       gpg-preset-passphrase is invoked this way:

         gpg-preset-passphrase [options] [command] cacheid

       cacheid is either a 40 character keygrip of hexadecimal characters identifying the key for which the  passphrase  should  be
       set or cleared.  The keygrip is listed along with the key when running the command: gpgsm --with-keygrip --list-secret-keys.
       Alternatively an arbitrary string may be used to identify a passphrase; it is suggested that such a string is prefixed  with
       the name of the application (e.g foo:12346).  Scripts should always use the option --with-colons, which provides the keygrip
       in a "grp" line (cf. ‘doc/DETAILS’)/

       One of the following command options must be given:

       --preset
              Preset a passphrase. This is what you usually will use. gpg-preset-passphrase will  then  read  the  passphrase  from
              stdin.

       --forget
              Flush the passphrase for the given cache ID from the cache.

       The following additional options may be used:

       -v
       --verbose
              Output additional information while running.

       -P string
       --passphrase string
              Instead  of  reading  the  passphrase  from  stdin,  use the supplied string as passphrase.  Note that this makes the
              passphrase visible for other users.

       The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If GnuPG and the  info  program  are  properly  in‐
       stalled at your site, the command

         info gnupg

       should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure and an index.
