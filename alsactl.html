NAME
       alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       alsactl [options] [store|restore|init] &lt;card # or id or device&gt;

       alsactl monitor &lt;card # or id&gt;

       alsactl info &lt;card # or id&gt;

       alsactl [clean] &lt;card # or id or device&gt; [[control identifiers]]

DESCRIPTION
       alsactl  is  used to control advanced settings for the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple soundcards. If your card
       has features that you can't seem to control from a mixer application, you have come to the right place.

COMMANDS
   Introduction
       The &lt;card&gt; argument is optional. If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will be saved, loaded or monitored.

   store &lt;card&gt;
       This command saves the current driver state for the selected soundcard to the configuration file.

   restore &lt;card&gt;
       This command loads driver state for the selected soundcard from the  configuration  file.  If  restoring  fails  (eventually
       partly), the init action is called.

   nrestore &lt;card&gt;
       This command is like restore, but it notifies also the daemon to do new rescan for available soundcards.

   init &lt;card&gt;
       This command tries to initialize all devices to a default state. If device is not known, error code 99 is returned.

   daemon
       This command manages to save periodically the sound state.

   rdaemon
       This command is like daemon but restore the sound state at first.

   kill &lt;cmd&gt;
       This command notifies the daemon to do the specified operation (quit, rescan, save_and_quit).

   monitor &lt;card&gt;
       This command is for monitoring the events received from the given control device.

   info &lt;card&gt;
       This command shows the general information in the YAML format collected from the given control device (sound card).

   clean &lt;card&gt; [filter]
       This command cleans the controls created by applications.

       The optional element identifiers are accepted as a filter. One extra argument is parsed as an element identifiers.

       Example: alsactl clean 0 "name='PCM'" "name='Mic Phantom'"

   dump-state
       This command dumps the current state (all cards) to stdout.

   dump-cfg
       This command dumps the current configuration (all cards) to stdout.  Note that the configuration hooks are evaluated.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show available flags and commands.

       -d, --debug
              Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.

       -v, --version
              Print alsactl version number.

       -f, --file
              Select the configuration file to use. The default is /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.

       -a, --config-dir
              Select the boot / hotplug ALSA configuration directory to use. The default is /var/lib/alsa.

       -l, --lock
              Use  the  file  locking  to  serialize the concurrent access to the state file (this option is default for the global
              state file).

       -L, --no-lock
              Do not use the file locking to serialize the concurrent access to the state file (including the global state file).

       -O, --lock-state-file
              Select the state lock file path.

       -F, --force
              Used with restore command.  Try to restore the matching control elements as much as possible.  This option is set  as
              default now.

       -g, --ignore
              Used  with store, restore and init commands. Do not show 'No soundcards found' and do not set an error exit code when
              soundcards are not installed.

       -P, --pedantic
              Used with restore command.  Don't restore mismatching control elements.  This option was the old default behavior.

       -I, --no-init-fallback
              Don't initialize cards if restore fails.  Since version 1.0.18, alsactl tries to initialize the card with the restore
              operation  as  default.   But  this can cause incompatibility with the older version.  The caller may expect that the
              state won't be touched if no state file exists.  This option takes the restore behavior back to the older version  by
              suppressing the initialization.

       -r, --runstate
              Save  restore and init state to this file. The file will contain only errors.  Errors are appended with the soundcard
              id to the end of file.

       -R, --remove
              Remove runstate file at first.

       -E, --env #=#
              Set environment variable (useful for init action or you may override ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read different or  optimized
              configuration - may be useful for "boot" scripts).

       -i, --initfile
              The configuration file for init. By default, PREFIX/share/alsa/init/00main is used.

       -p, --period
              The store period in seconds for the daemon command.

       -e, --pid-file
              The pathname to store the process-id file in the HDB UUCP format (ASCII).

       -b, --background
              Run the task in background.

       -s, --syslog
              Use syslog for messages.

       -n, --nice
              Set the process priority (see 'man nice')

       -c, --sched-idle
              Set the process scheduling policy to idle (SCHED_IDLE).

       -D, --ucm-defaults
              Execute also the 'defaults' section from the UCM configuration. The standard behaviour is to execute only 'once' sec‐
              tion.

       -U, --no-ucm
              Skip the UCM init even if available. It may be useful for the test the legacy init configuration.

FILES
       /var/lib/alsa/asound.state (or whatever file you specify with the -f flag) is used to store current settings for your sound‐
       cards.  The  settings  include  all the usual soundcard mixer settings.  More importantly, alsactl is capable of controlling
       other card-specific features that mixer apps usually don't know about.

       The configuration file is generated automatically by running alsactl store. Editing the configuration file by  hand  may  be
       necessary for some soundcard features (e.g. enabling/disabling automatic mic gain, digital output, joystick/game ports, some
       future MIDI routing options, etc).

BUGS
       None known.
