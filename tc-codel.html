NAME
       CoDel - Controlled-Delay Active Queue Management algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       tc qdisc ... codel [ limit PACKETS ] [ target TIME ] [ interval TIME ] [ ecn | noecn ] [ ce_threshold TIME ]

DESCRIPTION
       CoDel  (pronounced  "coddle") is an adaptive "no-knobs" active queue management algorithm (AQM) scheme that was developed to
       address the shortcomings of RED and its variants. It was developed with the following goals in mind:
        o It should be parameterless.
        o It should keep delays low while permitting bursts of traffic.
        o It should control delay.
        o It should adapt dynamically to changing link rates with no impact on utilization.
        o It should be simple and efficient and should scale from simple to complex routers.

ALGORITHM
       CoDel comes with three major innovations. Instead of using queue size or queue average, it uses the local minimum queue as a
       measure  of  the  standing/persistent  queue.   Second, it uses a single state-tracking variable of the minimum delay to see
       where it is relative to the standing queue delay. Third, instead of measuring queue size in bytes or packets, it is measured
       in packet-sojourn time in the queue.

       CoDel  measures  the minimum local queue delay (i.e. standing queue delay) and compares it to the value of the given accept‐
       able queue delay target.  As long as the minimum queue delay is less than target or the buffer contains fewer than MTU worth
       of bytes, packets are not dropped.  Codel enters a dropping mode when the minimum queue delay has exceeded target for a time
       greater than interval.  In this mode, packets are dropped at different drop times which is set by a control law. The control
       law ensures that the packet drops cause a linear change in the throughput. Once the minimum delay goes below target, packets
       are no longer dropped.

       Additional details can be found in the paper cited below.

PARAMETERS
   limit
       hard limit on the real queue size. When this limit is reached, incoming packets are dropped. If the value is lowered,  pack‐
       ets are dropped so that the new limit is met. Default is 1000 packets.

   target
       is  the  acceptable  minimum standing/persistent queue delay. This minimum delay is identified by tracking the local minimum
       queue delay that packets experience.  Default and recommended value is 5ms.

   interval
       is used to ensure that the measured minimum delay does not become too stale. The minimum delay must be  experienced  in  the
       last epoch of length interval.  It should be set on the order of the worst-case RTT through the bottleneck to give endpoints
       sufficient time to react. Default value is 100ms.

   ecn | noecn
       can be used to mark packets instead of dropping them. If ecn has been enabled, noecn can be used to turn it off and  vice-a-
       versa. By default, ecn is turned off.

   ce_threshold
       sets  a threshold above which all packets are marked with ECN Congestion Experienced. This is useful for DCTCP-style conges‐
       tion control algorithms that require marking at very shallow queueing thresholds.

EXAMPLES
        # tc qdisc add dev eth0 root codel
        # tc -s qdisc show
          qdisc codel 801b: dev eth0 root refcnt 2 limit 1000p target 5.0ms interval 100.0ms
           Sent 245801662 bytes 275853 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 24)
           backlog 0b 0p requeues 24
            count 0 lastcount 0 ldelay 2us drop_next 0us
            maxpacket 7306 ecn_mark 0 drop_overlimit 0

        # tc qdisc add dev eth0 root codel limit 100 target 4ms interval 30ms ecn
        # tc -s qdisc show
          qdisc codel 801c: dev eth0 root refcnt 2 limit 100p target 4.0ms interval 30.0ms ecn
           Sent 237573074 bytes 268561 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 5)
           backlog 0b 0p requeues 5
            count 0 lastcount 0 ldelay 76us drop_next 0us
            maxpacket 2962 ecn_mark 0 drop_overlimit 0
