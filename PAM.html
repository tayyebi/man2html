<pre>PAM(7)                                                    Linux-PAM Manual                                                   PAM(7)

NAME
       PAM, pam - Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux

DESCRIPTION
       This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to Linux-PAM. For more information the reader is directed to the
       Linux-PAM system administrators' guide.

       Linux-PAM is a system of libraries that handle the authentication tasks of applications (services) on the system. The
       library provides a stable general interface (Application Programming Interface - API) that privilege granting programs (such
       as login(1) and su(1)) defer to to perform standard authentication tasks.

       The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the authentication is dynamically configurable. In other
       words, the system administrator is free to choose how individual service-providing applications will authenticate users.
       This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of the single Linux-PAM configuration file /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively,
       the configuration can be set by individual configuration files located in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. The presence of this
       directory will cause Linux-PAM to ignore /etc/pam.conf.

       Vendor-supplied PAM configuration files might be installed in the system directory /usr/lib/pam.d/ or a configurable vendor
       specific directory instead of the machine configuration directory /etc/pam.d/. If no machine configuration file is found,
       the vendor-supplied file is used. All files in /etc/pam.d/ override files with the same name in other directories.

       From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is provided, it is not of primary importance to
       understand the internal behavior of the Linux-PAM library. The important point to recognize is that the configuration
       file(s) define the connection between applications (services) and the pluggable authentication modules (PAMs) that perform
       the actual authentication tasks.

       Linux-PAM separates the tasks of authentication into four independent management groups: account management; authentication
       management; password management; and session management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these groups in the
       configuration file.)

       Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a typical user's request for a restricted service:

       account - provide account verification types of service: has the user's password expired?; is this user permitted access to
       the requested service?

       authentication - authenticate a user and set up user credentials. Typically this is via some challenge-response request that
       the user must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your password. Not all authentications are of this type,
       there exist hardware based authentication schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable
       modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for more standard approaches to authentication - such is the flexibility of
       Linux-PAM.

       password - this group's responsibility is the task of updating authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are
       strongly coupled to those of the auth group. Some authentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being updated with such
       a function. Standard UN*X password-based access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement password.

       session - this group of tasks cover things that should be done prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn.
       Such tasks include the maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of the user's home directory. The session management
       group is important as it provides both an opening and closing hook for modules to affect the services available to a user.

FILES
       /etc/pam.conf
           the configuration file

       /etc/pam.d
           the Linux-PAM configuration directory. Generally, if this directory is present, the /etc/pam.conf file is ignored.

       /usr/lib/pam.d
           the Linux-PAM vendor configuration directory. Files in /etc/pam.d override files with the same name in this directory.

       &lt;vendordir&gt;/pam.d
           the Linux-PAM vendor configuration directory. Files in /etc/pam.d and /usr/lib/pam.d override files with the same name
           in this directory. Only available if Linux-PAM was compiled with vendordir enabled.

ERRORS
       Typically errors generated by the Linux-PAM system of libraries, will be written to syslog(3).

CONFORMING TO
       DCE-RFC 86.0, October 1995. Contains additional features, but remains backwardly compatible with this RFC.
