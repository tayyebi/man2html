NAME
       fsfreeze - suspend access to a filesystem (Ext3/4, ReiserFS, JFS, XFS)

SYNOPSIS
       fsfreeze --freeze|--unfreeze mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       fsfreeze suspends or resumes access to a filesystem.

       fsfreeze halts any new access to the filesystem and creates a stable image on disk. fsfreeze is intended to be used with
       hardware RAID devices that support the creation of snapshots.

       fsfreeze is unnecessary for device-mapper devices. The device-mapper (and LVM) automatically freezes a filesystem on the
       device when a snapshot creation is requested. For more details see the dmsetup(8) man page.

       The mountpoint argument is the pathname of the directory where the filesystem is mounted. The filesystem must be mounted to
       be frozen (see mount(8)).

       Note that access-time updates are also suspended if the filesystem is mounted with the traditional atime behavior (mount
       option strictatime, for more details see mount(8)).

OPTIONS
       -f, --freeze
           This option requests the specified filesystem to be frozen from new modifications. When this is selected, all ongoing
           transactions in the filesystem are allowed to complete, new write(2) system calls are halted, other calls which modify
           the filesystem are halted, and all dirty data, metadata, and log information are written to disk. Any process attempting
           to write to the frozen filesystem will block waiting for the filesystem to be unfrozen.

           Note that even after freezing, the on-disk filesystem can contain information on files that are still in the process of
           unlinking. These files will not be unlinked until the filesystem is unfrozen or a clean mount of the snapshot is
           complete.

       -u, --unfreeze
           This option is used to un-freeze the filesystem and allow operations to continue. Any filesystem modifications that were
           blocked by the freeze are unblocked and allowed to complete.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.

FILESYSTEM SUPPORT
       This command will work only if filesystem supports has support for freezing. List of these filesystems include (2016-12-18)
       btrfs, ext2/3/4, f2fs, jfs, nilfs2, reiserfs, and xfs. Previous list may be incomplete, as more filesystems get support. If
       in doubt easiest way to know if a filesystem has support is create a small loopback mount and test freezing it.

NOTES
       This man page is based on xfs_freeze(8).
