NAME
       HTTP::Request::Common - Construct common HTTP::Request objects

VERSION
       version 6.44

SYNOPSIS
         use HTTP::Request::Common;
         $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
         $ua-&gt;request(GET 'http://www.sn.no/');
         $ua-&gt;request(POST 'http://somewhere/foo', foo =&gt; bar, bar =&gt; foo);
         $ua-&gt;request(PATCH 'http://somewhere/foo', foo =&gt; bar, bar =&gt; foo);
         $ua-&gt;request(PUT 'http://somewhere/foo', foo =&gt; bar, bar =&gt; foo);
         $ua-&gt;request(OPTIONS 'http://somewhere/foo', foo =&gt; bar, bar =&gt; foo);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions that return newly created "HTTP::Request" objects.  These functions are usually more
       convenient to use than the standard "HTTP::Request" constructor for the most common requests.

       Note that LWP::UserAgent has several convenience methods, including "get", "head", "delete", "post" and "put".

       The following functions are provided:

       GET $url
       GET $url, Header =&gt; Value,...
           The "GET" function returns an HTTP::Request object initialized with the "GET" method and the specified URL.  It is
           roughly equivalent to the following call

             HTTP::Request-&gt;new(
                GET =&gt; $url,
                HTTP::Headers-&gt;new(Header =&gt; Value,...),
             )

           but is less cluttered.  What is different is that a header named "Content" will initialize the content part of the
           request instead of setting a header field.  Note that GET requests should normally not have a content, so this hack
           makes more sense for the "PUT", "PATCH"
            and "POST" functions described below.

           The "get(...)" method of LWP::UserAgent exists as a shortcut for "$ua-&gt;request(GET ...)".

       HEAD $url
       HEAD $url, Header =&gt; Value,...
           Like GET() but the method in the request is "HEAD".

           The "head(...)"  method of LWP::UserAgent exists as a shortcut for "$ua-&gt;request(HEAD ...)".

       DELETE $url
       DELETE $url, Header =&gt; Value,...
           Like "GET" but the method in the request is "DELETE".  This function is not exported by default.

       PATCH $url
       PATCH $url, Header =&gt; Value,...
       PATCH $url, $form_ref, Header =&gt; Value,...
       PATCH $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $form_ref
       PATCH $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $content
           The same as "POST" below, but the method in the request is "PATCH".

       PUT $url
       PUT $url, Header =&gt; Value,...
       PUT $url, $form_ref, Header =&gt; Value,...
       PUT $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $form_ref
       PUT $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $content
           The same as "POST" below, but the method in the request is "PUT"

       OPTIONS $url
       OPTIONS $url, Header =&gt; Value,...
       OPTIONS $url, $form_ref, Header =&gt; Value,...
       OPTIONS $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $form_ref
       OPTIONS $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $content
           The same as "POST" below, but the method in the request is "OPTIONS"

           This was added in version 6.21, so you should require that in your code:

            use HTTP::Request::Common 6.21;

       POST $url
       POST $url, Header =&gt; Value,...
       POST $url, $form_ref, Header =&gt; Value,...
       POST $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $form_ref
       POST $url, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $content
           "POST", "PATCH" and "PUT" all work with the same parameters.

             %data = ( title =&gt; 'something', body =&gt; something else' );
             $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new();
             $request = HTTP::Request::Common::POST( $url, [ %data ] );
             $response = $ua-&gt;request($request);

           They take a second optional array or hash reference parameter $form_ref.  The content can also be specified directly
           using the "Content" pseudo-header, and you may also provide the $form_ref this way.

           The "Content" pseudo-header steals a bit of the header field namespace as there is no way to directly specify a header
           that is actually called "Content".  If you really need this you must update the request returned in a separate
           statement.

           The $form_ref argument can be used to pass key/value pairs for the form content.  By default we will initialize a
           request using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type.  This means that you can emulate an HTML &lt;form&gt;
           POSTing like this:

             POST 'http://www.perl.org/survey.cgi',
                  [ name   =&gt; 'Gisle Aas',
                    email  =&gt; 'gisle@aas.no',
                    gender =&gt; 'M',
                    born   =&gt; '1964',
                    perc   =&gt; '3%',
                  ];

           This will create an HTTP::Request object that looks like this:

             POST http://www.perl.org/survey.cgi
             Content-Length: 66
             Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

             name=Gisle%20Aas&amp;email=gisle%40aas.no&amp;gender=M&amp;born=1964&amp;perc=3%25

           Multivalued form fields can be specified by either repeating the field name or by passing the value as an array
           reference.

           The POST method also supports the "multipart/form-data" content used for Form-based File Upload as specified in RFC
           1867.  You trigger this content format by specifying a content type of 'form-data' as one of the request headers.  If
           one of the values in the $form_ref is an array reference, then it is treated as a file part specification with the
           following interpretation:

             [ $file, $filename, Header =&gt; Value... ]
             [ undef, $filename, Header =&gt; Value,..., Content =&gt; $content ]

           The first value in the array ($file) is the name of a file to open.  This file will be read and its content placed in
           the request.  The routine will croak if the file can't be opened.  Use an "undef" as $file value if you want to specify
           the content directly with a "Content" header.  The $filename is the filename to report in the request.  If this value is
           undefined, then the basename of the $file will be used.  You can specify an empty string as $filename if you want to
           suppress sending the filename when you provide a $file value.

           If a $file is provided by no "Content-Type" header, then "Content-Type" and "Content-Encoding" will be filled in
           automatically with the values returned by "LWP::MediaTypes::guess_media_type()"

           Sending my ~/.profile to the survey used as example above can be achieved by this:

             POST 'http://www.perl.org/survey.cgi',
                  Content_Type =&gt; 'form-data',
                  Content      =&gt; [ name  =&gt; 'Gisle Aas',
                                    email =&gt; 'gisle@aas.no',
                                    gender =&gt; 'M',
                                    born   =&gt; '1964',
                                    init   =&gt; ["$ENV{HOME}/.profile"],
                                  ]

           This will create an HTTP::Request object that almost looks this (the boundary and the content of your ~/.profile is
           likely to be different):

             POST http://www.perl.org/survey.cgi
             Content-Length: 388
             Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary="6G+f"

             --6G+f
             Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"

             Gisle Aas
             --6G+f
             Content-Disposition: form-data; name="email"

             gisle@aas.no
             --6G+f
             Content-Disposition: form-data; name="gender"

             M
             --6G+f
             Content-Disposition: form-data; name="born"

             1964
             --6G+f
             Content-Disposition: form-data; name="init"; filename=".profile"
             Content-Type: text/plain

             PATH=/local/perl/bin:$PATH
             export PATH

             --6G+f--

           If you set the $DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD variable (exportable) to some TRUE value, then you get back a request object with a
           subroutine closure as the content attribute.  This subroutine will read the content of any files on demand and return it
           in suitable chunks.  This allow you to upload arbitrary big files without using lots of memory.  You can even upload
           infinite files like /dev/audio if you wish; however, if the file is not a plain file, there will be no "Content-Length"
           header defined for the request.  Not all servers (or server applications) like this.  Also, if the file(s) change in
           size between the time the "Content-Length" is calculated and the time that the last chunk is delivered, the subroutine
           will "Croak".

           The "post(...)"  method of LWP::UserAgent exists as a shortcut for "$ua-&gt;request(POST ...)".

       explained there.
