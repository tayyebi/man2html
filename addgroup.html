DESCRIPTION
       adduser and addgroup add users and groups to the system according to command line options and configuration  information  in
       /etc/adduser.conf.   They  are  friendlier front ends to the low level tools like useradd, groupadd and usermod programs, by
       default choosing Debian policy conformant UID and GID values, creating a home directory with skeletal configuration, running
       a custom script, and other features.

       adduser  and  addgroup  are intended as a policy layer, making it easier for package maintainers and local administrators to
       create local system accounts in the way Debian expects them to be created, taking the burden to adapt to the probably chang‐
       ing  specifications  of Debian policy. adduser --system takes special attention on just needing a single call in the package
       maintainer scripts without any conditional wrappers, error suppression or other scaffolding.

       adduser honors the distinction between dynamically allocated system users and groups and dynamically allocated user accounts
       that is documented in Debian Policy, Chapter 9.2.2.

       adduser and addgroup can be run in one of five modes:

   Add a normal user
       If  called  with  one non-option argument and without the --system or --group  options, adduser will add a normal user, that
       means a dynamically allocated user account in the sense of Debian Policy. This is commonly referred to in adduser as a  non-
       system user.

       adduser  will  choose  the first available UID from the range specified for normal users in the configuration file.  The UID
       can be overridden with the --uid option.

       The range specified in the configuration file may be overridden with the --firstuid and --lastuid options.

       By default, each user in Debian GNU/Linux is given a corresponding  group  with  the  same  name.   Usergroups  allow  group
       writable directories to be easily maintained by placing the appropriate users in the new group, setting the set-group-ID bit
       in the directory (which is on by default), and ensuring that all users use a umask of 002.  If USERS_GID or USERS_GROUP  are
       set,  the  newly  created  user  is  placed  in  the  referenced group as a supplemental group. . Setting both USERS_GID and
       USERS_GROUP is an error even if the settings are consistent.  If USERGROUPS is no,  all  users  get  the  group  defined  by
       USERS_GID  or  USERS_GROUP  as their primary group.  Users' primary groups can also be overridden from the command line with
       the --gid  or --ingroup options to set the group by id or name, respectively.  Also, users can be added to one or more  sup‐
       plemental  groups  defined  in adduser.conf either by setting ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS to 1 in adduser.conf, or by passing --add-ex‐
       tra-groups on the commandline.

       adduser will create a home directory subject to DHOME, GROUPHOMES, and LETTERHOMES.  The home directory  can  be  overridden
       from  the command line with the --home option, and the shell with the --shell option.  The home directory's set-group-ID bit
       is set if USERGROUPS is yes so that any files created in the user's home directory will have the correct group.

       adduser will copy files from SKEL into the home directory and prompt for finger (GECOS) information  and  a  password.   The
       GECOS field may also be set with the --gecos option.  With the --disabled-login option, the account will be created but will
       be disabled until a password is set.  The --disabled-password option will not set a password, but login  is  still  possible
       (for  example  with  SSH keys).  To set up an encrypted home directory for the new user, add the --encrypt-home option.  For
       more information, refer to the -b option of ecryptfs-setup-private(1).

       If the file /usr/local/sbin/adduser.local exists, it will be executed after the user account has been set up in order to  do
       any local setup.

       adduser.local  is also the place where local administrators can place their code to interact with directory services, should
       they desire to.

       The arguments passed to adduser.local are:
       username uid gid home-directory

       The environment variable VERBOSE is set according to the following rule:

       0      if  --quiet is specified

       1      if neither --quiet nor --debug is specified

       2      if --debug is specified

       (The same applies to the variable DEBUG, but DEBUG is deprecated and will be removed in a later version of adduser.)

   Add a system user
       If called with one non-option argument and the --system option, adduser will add a dynamically allocated system user,  often
       abbreviated as system user in the context of the adduser package.  If a user with the same name already exists in the system
       uid range (or, if the uid is specified, if a user with that uid already exists), adduser will exit  with  a  warning.   This
       warning can be suppressed by adding --quiet.

       adduser  will choose the first available UID from the range specified for system users in the configuration file (FIRST_SYS‐
       TEM_UID and LAST_SYSTEM_UID).  If you want to have a specific UID, you can specify it using the --uid option.

       By default, system users are placed in the nogroup group.  To place the new system user in an already  existing  group,  use
       the --gid or --ingroup options.  To place the new system user in a new group with the same ID, use the --group option.

       A  home directory should be specified using the --home option. If not specified, the default home directory for a new system
       user is /nonexistent. This directory should never exist on any Debian system, and adduser will not create it automatically.

       The new system user will have the shell /usr/sbin/nologin (unless overridden with the --shell option).  Standard UNIX  pass‐
       word  logins  will  be disabled for the new system user; however, logins by other means (for example, via SSH) are still al‐
       lowed.  Skeletal configuration files are not copied.

   Add a user group
       If adduser is called with the --group option and without the --system option, or addgroup is  called  respectively,  a  user
       group will be added.

       A  GID will be chosen from the range specified for system GIDs in the configuration file (FIRST_GID, LAST_GID).  To override
       that mechanism you can give the GID using the --gid option.

       The range specified in the configuration file may be overridden with the --firstgid and --lastgid options.

       The group is created with no users.

   Add a system group
       If addgroup is called with the --system option, a dynamically allocated system group, often abbreviated as system  group  in
       the context of the adduser package, will be created.

       A GID will be chosen from the range specified for system GIDs in the configuration file (FIRST_SYSTEM_GID, LAST_SYSTEM_GID).
       To override that mechanism you can give the GID using the --gid option.  The system group is created with no users.

   Add an existing user to an existing group
       If called with two non-option arguments, adduser will add an existing user to an existing group.

OPTIONS
       -c file,--conf file
              Use file instead of /etc/adduser.conf.

       --disabled-login
              Do not run passwd to set the password.  The user won't be able to use her account until the password is set.

       --disabled-password
              Like --disabled-login, but logins are still possible (for example using SSH keys) but not using password  authentica‐
              tion.

       --allow-badname
              By  default,  user  and  group  names  are  checked  against  the  configurable  regular  expression  NAME_REGEX  and
              SYS_NAME_REGEX specified in the configuration file. This option forces adduser and addgroup  to  apply  only  a  weak
              check for validity of the name.  NAME_REGEX and SYS_NAME_REGEX are described in adduser.conf(5).

       --force-badname
              This is the deprecated form of --allow-badname. It will be removed during the release cycle of the Debian release af‐
              ter bookworm.

       --allow-all-names
              Bypass the weak name check which is used with --allow-badname.  This will allow any username which  is  supported  by
              the  underlying  useradd,  including  names  containing non-ASCII characters.  The only restrictions enforced at this
              level are: cannot start with a dash, plus sign, or tilde; and cannot contain a colon, comma, slash, or whitespace.

       --gecos GECOS
              Set the GECOS field for the new entry generated.  adduser will not ask for  finger  information  if  this  option  is
              given.

       --gid ID
              When  creating a group, this option sets the group ID number of the new group to GID.  When creating a user, this op‐
              tion sets the primary group ID number of the new user to GID.

       --ingroup GROUP
              When creating a user, this option sets the primary group ID number of the new user to the GID  of  the  named  GROUP.
              Unlike  with  the  --gid option, the group is specified here by name rather than by ID number. The group must already
              exist.

       --group
              When combined with --system , a group with the same name and ID as the system user is created.  If not combined  with
              --system , a group with the given name is created.  This is the default action if the program is invoked as addgroup.

       -h, --help
              Display brief instructions.

       --home dir
              Use  dir as the user's home directory, rather than the default specified by the configuration file.  If the directory
              does not exist, it is created and skeleton files are copied.

       --shell shell
              Use shell as the user's login shell, rather than the default specified by the configuration file.

       --no-create-home
              Do not create a home directory for the new user. Note that the path name for the new user's home directory will still
              be  entered  in  the appropriate field in the /etc/passwd file. The use of this option does not imply that this field
              should be empty. Rather, it indicates to adduser that some other mechanism will be responsible for  initializing  the
              new user's home directory if it is to exist.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress informational messages, only show warnings and errors.

       -d, --debug
              Be verbose, most useful if you want to nail down a problem with adduser.

       --system
              Nomally,  adduser  creates dynamically allocated user accounts and groups as defined in Debian Policy, Chapter 9.2.2.
              With this option, adduser creates a dynamically allocated system user and group.

       --uid ID
              Force the new userid to be the given number.  adduser will fail if the userid is already taken.

       --firstuid ID
              Override the first uid in the range that the uid is chosen from (overrides FIRST_UID specified in  the  configuration
              file).

       --lastuid ID
              Override the last uid in the range that the uid is chosen from (LAST_UID).

       --firstgid ID
              Override  the  first gid in the range that the gid is chosen from (overrides FIRST_GID specified in the configuration
              file).

       --lastgid ID
              Override the last gid in the range that the gid is chosen from (LAST_GID).

       --add-extra-groups
              Add new user to extra groups defined in the configuration file. Old spelling  --add_extra_groups  is  deprecated  and
              will be supported in Debian bookworm only.

       -v , --version
              Display version and copyright information.

EXIT VALUES
       0      Success:  The  user or group exists as specified.  This can have 2 causes: The user or group was created by this call
              to adduser or the user or group was already present on the system before adduser was invoked. If adduser --system  is
              invoked for a user already existing as a system user, it will also return 0.

       1      Creating  the non-system user or group failed because it was already present.  The username or groupname was rejected
              because of a mismatch with the configured regular expressions, see adduser.conf(5).  adduser has been  aborted  by  a
              signal.
              Or  for  many  other  yet  undocumented  reasons  which are printed to console then.  You may then consider to remove
              --quiet to make adduser more verbose.

SECURITY
       adduser needs root privileges and offers, via the --conf command line option to use a different configuration file.  Do  not
       use  sudo  or  similar  tools to give partial privileges to adduser with restricted command line parameters. This is easy to
       circumvent and might allow users to create arbitrary accounts. If you want this, consider writing your  own  wrapper  script
       and giving privileges to execute that script.

FILES
       /etc/adduser.conf
              Default configuration file for adduser and addgroup

       /usr/local/sbin/adduser.local
              Optional custom add-ons.

NOTES
       Unfortunately,  the  term  system account suffers from double use in Debian.  It both means an account for the actual Debian
       system, distinguishing itself from an application accountP which might exist in the user database of some  application  run‐
       ning on Debian. A system account in this definition has the potential to log in to the actual system, has a UID, can be mem‐
       ber in system groups, can own files and processes. Debian Policy, au contraire, in its Chapter 9.2.2, makes  a  distinguish‐
       ment  of dynamically allocated system users and groups and dynamially allocated user accounts, meaning in both cases special
       instances of system accounts. Care must be taken to not confuse this terminology. Since adduser and  deluser  never  address
       application  accounts  and everything in this package concerns system accounts here, the usage of the terms user account and
       system account is actually not ambiguous in the context of this package. For clarity, this document uses the definition  lo‐
       cal system account or group if the distinction to application accounts or accounts managed in a directory service is needed.

       adduser used to have the vision to be the universal front end to the various directory services for creation and deletion of
       regular and system accounts in Debian since the 1990ies. This vision has been abandoned as of  2022.  The  rationale  behind
       this  includes:  that  in  practice, a small server system is not going to have write access to an enterprise-wide directory
       service anyway, that locally installed packages are hard to manage with centrally controlled system  accounts,  that  enter‐
       prise  directory  services have their own management processes anyway and that the personpower of the adduser is unlikely to
       be ever strong enough to write or support the plethora of directory services that need support.

       adduser will constrict itself to being a policy layer for the management of local system accounts, using the tools from  the
       password package for the actual work.

BUGS
       Inconsistent use of terminology around the term system account in docs and code is a bug. Please report this and allow us to
       improve our docs.

       adduser takes special attention to be directly usable in Debian maintainer scripts without conditional wrappers, error  sup‐
       pression  and  other scaffolding. The only thing that the package maintainer should need to code is a check for the presence
       of the executable in the postrm script. The adduser maintainers consider the need for additional scaffolding a bug  and  en‐
       courage their fellow Debian package maintainers to file bugs against the adduser package in this case.
