<pre>ansi2html(1)                                          General Commands Manual                                          ansi2html(1)

NAME
       ansi2html - ansi to HTML converter

SYNOPSIS
       ansi2html [-nwctl] &lt;log &gt;outfile

DESCRIPTION
       ansi2html will convert the ANSI log into an HTML page, converting ANSI color codes into appropriate tags.  All common colors
       and attributes are supported.

OPTIONS
       -n, --no-header
              Don't produce an HTML header.  This allows including the log into a web page you make some other way.   You  are  re‐
              sponsible for setting background color appropriately — to black or something dark in the default on-black mode, or to
              white/light when -w is used.  Fancy-schmancy background images are fine as long as they are dark (or light) enough.

       -w, --white
              Make the background white.  This is contrary to most terminals but matches  most  webpages.   Text  requested  to  be
              bolded (normally bright white) will be turned bold black, but explicit bright white will not be changed, becoming in‐
              visible (just like explicit black is invisible in the normal on-black mode), same as on real terminals (see -c).

       -c, --contrast
              Forbid invisible text.  Whenever foreground color is same as background, it'll be turned  halfway  across  the  color
              space  (so  white and black become gray).  This is inaccurate wrt real terminals, and most web users already know how
              to mouse-highlight "spoiler" text, but can be useful if you process logs that assume different  white-vs-black  back‐
              ground than you.

       -t, --title text
              Set the page title to the next argument.  Mutually exclusive with -n.

       -l, --no-wrap
              Disable  word-wrapping.  Like text terminals, ansi2html wraps text by default, which is contrary to the usual browser
              default for plain text.

       --style text
              Injects some text into the stylesheet, obviously doesn't make any sense with -n.  Example: --style 'pre {font-family:
              Consolas}'

CAVEATS
       Most  ANSI codes other than color codes are ignored; possibly causing misformatted output.  In general, anything unfit for a
       hardcopy terminal won't work.

SEE ALSO
       ansi2txt(1), ttyrec2ansi(1), pipetty(1).
