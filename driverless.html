NAME
       driverless - PPD generator utility for driverless printing

SYNOPSIS
       driverless [-h | --help | --version] [-d | -v | --debug] [list] [_ipps._tcp] [_ipp._tcp] [--std-ipp-uris] | [cat driver URI] | [IPP printer URI]

DESCRIPTION
       driverless  generates  PPD files for printers which are designed for driverless IPP printing (currently IPP Everywhere, Air‐
       Print, Mopria, and Wi-Fi-Direct printers, network printers and also IPP-over-USB printers with the help of  ippusbxd(8))  by
       polling  capability information from the printers via IPP. it can be either called for listing suitable printers in the net‐
       work and for actually generating the PPD. It can also be called by CUPS when CUPS is listing available PPDs/drivers or  cre‐
       ating print queues, making the setup of driverless printers with printer setup tools transparently working.

       driverless  is  placed  in  /usr/lib/cups/driver/  for listing available driverless-capable printers and generating PPDs for
       them. It should also be put in /usr/lib/cups/backend/ (preferably by a symbolic link) to list IPP device URIs  for  suitable
       printers. Printer setup tools like system-config-printer, the CUPS web interface at http://localhost:631/, and CUPS' command
       line utilities can use driverless with CUPS to list available driverless-capable printers, determine their IPP  device  URIs
       and  generate  PPDs  for  them.  The  printers will be automatically and correctly set up for driverless printing. Note that
       driverless printing requires IPP communication with the printer.

       A second symbolic link to /usr/lib/cups/driver/driverless from /usr/bin/ allows driverless to be called directly by a user.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help, --version
              Show help page, including version number.

       -v, -d, --debug
              Debug mode, verbose logging to stderr.

       list   List the driver URIs and metadata for all available IPP/IPPS printers suitable for driverless PPD file generation (to
              be used by CUPS).

       _ipps._tcp
              Check for only IPPS printers supporting driverless printing .

       _ipp._tcp
              Check for only IPP printers supporting driverless printing .

       --std-ipp-uris
              Show URIS in standard form

       cat driver URI
              Generate the PPD file for the supplied driver URI from the output of "list" (to be used by CUPS).

       IPP printer URI
              Generate  the PPD file for the supplied IPP printer URI (suitable URIs are listed when calling driverless without op‐
              tions).

       When called without options, the IPP printer URIs of all available driverless-capable IPP printers will be listed.

       The authors of driverless are listed in /usr/share/doc/cups-filters/AUTHORS.
