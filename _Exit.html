<pre>_exit(2)                                                System Calls Manual                                                _exit(2)

NAME
       _exit, _Exit - terminate the calling process

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       [[noreturn]] void _exit(int status);

       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       [[noreturn]] void _Exit(int status);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       _Exit():
           _ISOC99_SOURCE || _POSIX_C_SOURCE &gt;= 200112L

DESCRIPTION
       _exit()  terminates  the calling process "immediately".  Any open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed.  Any
       children of the process are inherited by init(1) (or by the nearest "subreaper" process as defined through the  use  of  the
       prctl(2) PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER operation).  The process's parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.

       The  value  status &amp; 0xFF is returned to the parent process as the process's exit status, and can be collected by the parent
       using one of the wait(2) family of calls.

       The function _Exit() is equivalent to _exit().

RETURN VALUE
       These functions do not return.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.  The function _Exit() was introduced by C99.

NOTES
       For a discussion on the effects of an exit, the transmission of exit status, zombie processes, signals sent, and so on,  see
       exit(3).

       The  function  _exit()  is  like  exit(3),  but  does  not call any functions registered with atexit(3) or on_exit(3).  Open
       stdio(3) streams are not flushed.  On the other hand, _exit() does close open file descriptors, and this may  cause  an  un‐
       known  delay,  waiting  for  pending  output  to finish.  If the delay is undesired, it may be useful to call functions like
       tcflush(3) before calling _exit().  Whether any pending I/O is canceled, and which pending I/O may be canceled upon _exit(),
       is implementation-dependent.

   C library/kernel differences
       The  text  above  in DESCRIPTION describes the traditional effect of _exit(), which is to terminate a process, and these are
       the semantics specified by POSIX.1 and implemented by the C library wrapper function.  On modern systems, this means  termi‐
       nation of all threads in the process.

       By  contrast  with the C library wrapper function, the raw Linux _exit() system call terminates only the calling thread, and
       actions such as reparenting child processes or sending SIGCHLD to the parent process are performed only if this is the  last
       thread in the thread group.

       Up to glibc 2.3, the _exit() wrapper function invoked the kernel system call of the same name.  Since glibc 2.3, the wrapper
       function invokes exit_group(2), in order to terminate all of the threads in a process.
