              dotnet restore -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       The  dotnet  restore  command uses NuGet to restore dependencies as well as project-specific tools that are specified in the
       project file.  In most cases, you don’t need to explicitly use the dotnet restore command, since a NuGet restore is run  im‐
       plicitly if necessary when you run the following commands:

       • dotnet new

       • dotnet build

       • dotnet build-server

       • dotnet run

       • dotnet test

       • dotnet publish

       • dotnet pack

       Sometimes, it might be inconvenient to run the implicit NuGet restore with these commands.  For example, some automated sys‐
       tems, such as build systems, need to call dotnet restore explicitly to control when the restore occurs so that they can con‐
       trol  network usage.  To prevent the implicit NuGet restore, you can use the --no-restore flag with any of these commands to
       disable implicit restore.

              Signed package verification during restore operations requires a certificate root store that is valid for  both  code
              signing and timestamping.  See NuGet signed package verification for details.

   Specify feeds
       To  restore  the  dependencies,  NuGet  needs  the feeds where the packages are located.  Feeds are usually provided via the
       nuget.config configuration file.  A default configuration file is provided when the .NET SDK is installed.  To specify addi‐
       tional feeds, do one of the following:

       • Create  your  own  nuget.config  file in the project directory.  For more information, see Common NuGet configurations and
         nuget.config differences later in this article.

       • Use dotnet nuget commands such as dotnet nuget add source.

       You can override the nuget.config feeds with the -s option.

       For information about how to use authenticated feeds, see Consuming packages from authenticated feeds.

   Global packages folder
       For dependencies, you can specify where the restored packages are placed during the restore operation using  the  --packages
       argument.  If not specified, the default NuGet package cache is used, which is found in the .nuget/packages directory in the
       user’s home directory on all operating systems.  For example, /home/user1 on Linux or C: on Windows.

   Project-specific tooling
       For project-specific tooling, dotnet restore first restores the package in which the tool is packed, and  then  proceeds  to
       restore the tool’s dependencies as specified in its project file.

   nuget.config differences
       The  behavior  of the dotnet restore command is affected by the settings in the nuget.config file, if present.  For example,
       setting the globalPackagesFolder in nuget.config places the restored NuGet packages in the specified folder.  This is an al‐
       ternative  to  specifying  the  --packages option on the dotnet restore command.  For more information, see the nuget.config
       reference.

       There are three specific settings that dotnet restore ignores:

       • bindingRedirects

         Binding redirects don’t work with &lt;PackageReference&gt; elements and .NET only supports &lt;PackageReference&gt; elements for NuGet
         packages.

       • solution

         This setting is Visual Studio specific and doesn’t apply to .NET.  .NET doesn’t use a packages.config file and instead us‐
         es &lt;PackageReference&gt; elements for NuGet packages.

       • trustedSigners

         Support for cross-platform package signature verification was added in the .NET 5.0.100 SDK.

   Workload manifest downloads
       When you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads.  If  the
       download  is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For more information, see Advertising mani‐
       fests.

ARGUMENTS
       • ROOT

         Optional path to the project file to restore.

OPTIONS
       • --configfile &lt;FILE&gt;

         The NuGet configuration file (nuget.config) to use.  If specified, only the settings from this file will be used.  If  not
         specified, the hierarchy of configuration files from the current directory will be used.  For more information, see Common
         NuGet Configurations.

       • --disable-parallel

         Disables restoring multiple projects in parallel.

       • --force

         Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful.  Specifying  this  flag  is  the  same  as
         deleting the project.assets.json file.

       • --force-evaluate

         Forces restore to reevaluate all dependencies even if a lock file already exists.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --ignore-failed-sources

         Only warn about failed sources if there are packages meeting the version requirement.

       • --interactive

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.

       • --lock-file-path &lt;LOCK_FILE_PATH&gt;

         Output location where project lock file is written.  By default, this is PROJECT_ROOT.lock.json.

       • --locked-mode

         Don’t allow updating project lock file.

       • --no-cache

         Specifies to not cache HTTP requests.

       • --no-dependencies

         When restoring a project with project-to-project (P2P) references, restores the root project and not the references.

       • --packages &lt;PACKAGES_DIRECTORY&gt;

         Specifies the directory for restored packages.

       • -r|--runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;

         Specifies  a  runtime for the package restore.  This is used to restore packages for runtimes not explicitly listed in the
         &lt;RuntimeIdentifiers&gt; tag in the .csproj file.  For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog.

       • -s|--source &lt;SOURCE&gt;

         Specifies the URI of the NuGet package source to use during the restore operation.  This  setting  overrides  all  of  the
         sources specified in the nuget.config files.  Multiple sources can be provided by specifying this option multiple times.

       • --use-lock-file

         Enables project lock file to be generated and used with restore.

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets  the  verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
         The default is minimal.  For more information, see &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.LoggerVerbosity&gt;.

EXAMPLES
       • Restore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory:

                dotnet restore

       • Restore dependencies and tools for the app1 project found in the given path:

                dotnet restore ./projects/app1/app1.csproj

       • Restore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the file path provided as the source:

                dotnet restore -s c:\packages\mypackages

       • Restore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the two file paths provided as sources:

                dotnet restore -s c:\packages\mypackages -s c:\packages\myotherpackages

       • Restore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory showing detailed output:

                dotnet restore --verbosity detailed
