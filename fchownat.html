NAME
       chown, fchown, lchown, fchownat - change ownership of a file

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int chown(const char *pathname, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
       int fchown(int fd, uid_t owner, gid_t group);
       int lchown(const char *pathname, uid_t owner, gid_t group);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;           /* Definition of AT_* constants */
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int fchownat(int dirfd, const char *pathname,
                    uid_t owner, gid_t group, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       These  system  calls  change the owner and group of a file.  The chown(), fchown(), and lchown() system calls differ only in
       how the file is specified:

       •  chown() changes the ownership of the file specified by pathname, which is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.

       •  fchown() changes the ownership of the file referred to by the open file descriptor fd.

       •  lchown() is like chown(), but does not dereference symbolic links.

       Only a privileged process (Linux: one with the CAP_CHOWN capability) may change the owner of a file.  The owner  of  a  file
       may change the group of the file to any group of which that owner is a member.  A privileged process (Linux: with CAP_CHOWN)
       may change the group arbitrarily.

       If the owner or group is specified as -1, then that ID is not changed.

       When the owner or group of an executable file is changed by an unprivileged user, the S_ISUID  and  S_ISGID  mode  bits  are
       cleared.   POSIX  does not specify whether this also should happen when root does the chown(); the Linux behavior depends on
       the kernel version, and since Linux 2.2.13, root is treated like other users.  In case of a non-group-executable file (i.e.,
       one for which the S_IXGRP bit is not set) the S_ISGID bit indicates mandatory locking, and is not cleared by a chown().

       When the owner or group of an executable file is changed (by any user), all capability sets for the file are cleared.

   fchownat()
       The fchownat() system call operates in exactly the same way as chown(), except for the differences described here.

       If  the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file de‐
       scriptor dirfd (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling process, as is done by  chown()  for  a
       relative pathname).

       If  pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then pathname is interpreted relative to the current work‐
       ing directory of the calling process (like chown()).

       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.

       The flags argument is a bit mask created by ORing together 0 or more of the following values;

       AT_EMPTY_PATH (since Linux 2.6.39)
              If pathname is an empty string, operate on the file referred to by dirfd (which may  have  been  obtained  using  the
              open(2)  O_PATH  flag).  In this case, dirfd can refer to any type of file, not just a directory.  If dirfd is AT_FD‐
              CWD, the call operates on the current working directory.  This flag is Linux-specific; define _GNU_SOURCE  to  obtain
              its definition.

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
              If  pathname  is  a symbolic link, do not dereference it: instead operate on the link itself, like lchown().  (By de‐
              fault, fchownat() dereferences symbolic links, like chown().)

       See openat(2) for an explanation of the need for fchownat().

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Depending on the filesystem, errors other than those listed below can be returned.

       The more general errors for chown() are listed below.

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EBADF  (fchown()) fd is not a valid open file descriptor.

       EBADF  (fchownat()) pathname is relative but dirfd is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address space.

       EINVAL (fchownat()) Invalid flag specified in flags.

       EIO    (fchown()) A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving pathname.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              pathname is too long.

       ENOENT The file does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       ENOTDIR
              (fchownat()) pathname is relative and dirfd is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.

       EPERM  The calling process did not have the required permissions (see above) to change owner and/or group.

       EPERM  The file is marked immutable or append-only.  (See ioctl_iflags(2).)

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only filesystem.

VERSIONS
       fchownat() was added in Linux 2.6.16; library support was added in glibc 2.4.

STANDARDS
       chown(), fchown(), lchown(): 4.4BSD, SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

       The 4.4BSD version can be used only by the superuser (that is, ordinary users cannot give away files).

       fchownat(): POSIX.1-2008.

NOTES
   Ownership of new files
       When a new file is created (by, for example, open(2) or mkdir(2)), its owner is made the same as the filesystem user  ID  of
       the  creating  process.   The group of the file depends on a range of factors, including the type of filesystem, the options
       used to mount the filesystem, and whether or not the set-group-ID mode bit is enabled  on  the  parent  directory.   If  the
       filesystem  supports  the  -o grpid (or, synonymously -o bsdgroups) and -o nogrpid (or, synonymously -o sysvgroups) mount(8)
       options, then the rules are as follows:

       •  If the filesystem is mounted with -o grpid, then the group of a new file is made the same as that of  the  parent  direc‐
          tory.

       •  If the filesystem is mounted with -o nogrpid and the set-group-ID bit is disabled on the parent directory, then the group
          of a new file is made the same as the process's filesystem GID.

       •  If the filesystem is mounted with -o nogrpid and the set-group-ID bit is enabled on the parent directory, then the  group
          of a new file is made the same as that of the parent directory.

       As  at  Linux  4.12, the -o grpid and -o nogrpid mount options are supported by ext2, ext3, ext4, and XFS.  Filesystems that
       don't support these mount options follow the -o nogrpid rules.

   glibc notes
       On older kernels where fchownat() is unavailable, the glibc wrapper function falls back to the use of chown() and  lchown().
       When  pathname  is  a relative pathname, glibc constructs a pathname based on the symbolic link in /proc/self/fd that corre‐
       sponds to the dirfd argument.

   NFS
       The chown() semantics are deliberately violated on NFS filesystems which have UID mapping enabled.  Additionally, the seman‐
       tics  of all system calls which access the file contents are violated, because chown() may cause immediate access revocation
       on already open files.  Client side caching may lead to a delay between the time where ownership have been changed to  allow
       access for a user and the time where the file can actually be accessed by the user on other clients.

   Historical details
       The  original  Linux  chown(),  fchown(), and lchown() system calls supported only 16-bit user and group IDs.  Subsequently,
       Linux 2.4 added chown32(), fchown32(), and lchown32(), supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc  chown(),  fchown(),  and  lchown()
       wrapper functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel versions.

       Before  Linux  2.1.81  (except 2.1.46), chown() did not follow symbolic links.  Since Linux 2.1.81, chown() does follow sym‐
       bolic links, and there is a new system call lchown() that does not follow symbolic links.  Since Linux 2.1.86, this new call
       (that  has the same semantics as the old chown()) has got the same syscall number, and chown() got the newly introduced num‐
       ber.

EXAMPLES
       The following program changes the ownership of the file named in its second command-line argument to the value specified  in
       its  first  command-line  argument.   The new owner can be specified either as a numeric user ID, or as a username (which is
       converted to a user ID by using getpwnam(3) to perform a lookup in the system password file).

           if (argc != 3 || argv[1][0] == '\0') {
               fprintf(stderr, "%s &lt;owner&gt; &lt;file&gt;\n", argv[0]);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           uid = strtol(argv[1], &amp;endptr, 10);  /* Allow a numeric string */
