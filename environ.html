<pre>environ(7)                                        Miscellaneous Information Manual                                       environ(7)

NAME
       environ - user environment

SYNOPSIS
       extern char **environ;

DESCRIPTION
       The variable environ points to an array of pointers to strings called the "environment".  The last pointer in this array has
       the value NULL.  This array of strings is made available to the process by the execve(2) call when a new program is started.
       When a child process is created via fork(2), it inherits a copy of its parent's environment.

       By  convention, the strings in environ have the form "name=value".  The name is case-sensitive and may not contain the char‐
       acter "=".  The value can be anything that can be represented as a string.  The name and the value may not contain an embed‐
       ded null byte ('\0'), since this is assumed to terminate the string.

       Environment  variables  may be placed in the shell's environment by the export command in sh(1), or by the setenv command if
       you use csh(1).

       The initial environment of the shell is populated in various ways, such as definitions from /etc/environment that  are  pro‐
       cessed by pam_env(8) for all users at login time (on systems that employ pam(8)).  In addition, various shell initialization
       scripts, such as the system-wide /etc/profile script and per-user initializations script may include commands that add vari‐
       ables to the shell's environment; see the manual page of your preferred shell for details.

       Bourne-style shells support the syntax

           NAME=value command

       to create an environment variable definition only in the scope of the process that executes command.  Multiple variable def‐
       initions, separated by white space, may precede command.

       Arguments may also be placed in the environment at the point of an exec(3).  A C program can manipulate its environment  us‐
       ing the functions getenv(3), putenv(3), setenv(3), and unsetenv(3).

       What  follows is a list of environment variables typically seen on a system.  This list is incomplete and includes only com‐
       mon variables seen by average users in their day-to-day routine.  Environment variables specific to a particular program  or
       library function are documented in the ENVIRONMENT section of the appropriate manual page.

       USER   The name of the logged-in user (used by some BSD-derived programs).  Set at login time, see section NOTES below.

       LOGNAME
              The name of the logged-in user (used by some System-V derived programs).  Set at login time, see section NOTES below.

       HOME   A user's login directory.  Set at login time, see section NOTES below.

       LANG   The  name  of  a locale to use for locale categories when not overridden by LC_ALL or more specific environment vari‐
              ables such as LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, and LC_TIME (see locale(7) for further  de‐
              tails of the LC_* environment variables).

       PATH   The  sequence  of  directory prefixes that sh(1) and many other programs employ when searching for an executable file
              that is specified as a simple filename (i.a., a pathname that contains no slashes).  The prefixes  are  separated  by
              colons (:).  The list of prefixes is searched from beginning to end, by checking the pathname formed by concatenating
              a prefix, a slash, and the filename, until a file with execute permission is found.

              As a legacy feature, a zero-length prefix (specified as two adjacent colons, or an initial or terminating  colon)  is
              interpreted  to mean the current working directory.  However, use of this feature is deprecated, and POSIX notes that
              a conforming application shall use an explicit pathname (e.g., .)  to specify the current working directory.

              Analogously to PATH, one has CDPATH used by some shells to find the target of a  change  directory  command,  MANPATH
              used by man(1) to find manual pages, and so on.

       PWD    Absolute path to the current working directory; required to be partially canonical (no . or .. components).

       SHELL  The absolute pathname of the user's login shell.  Set at login time, see section NOTES below.

       TERM   The terminal type for which output is to be prepared.

       PAGER  The  user's  preferred utility to display text files.  Any string acceptable as a command-string operand to the sh -c
              command shall be valid.  If PAGER is null or is not set, then applications that launch a pager will default to a pro‐
              gram such as less(1) or more(1).

       EDITOR/VISUAL
              The user's preferred utility to edit text files.  Any string acceptable as a command_string operand to the sh -c com‐
              mand shall be valid.

       Note that the behavior of many programs and library routines is influenced by the presence or value of  certain  environment
       variables.  Examples include the following:

       •  The variables LANG, LANGUAGE, NLSPATH, LOCPATH, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and so on influence locale handling; see catopen(3),
          gettext(3), and locale(7).

       •  TMPDIR influences the path prefix of names created by tempnam(3) and other routines, and the temporary directory used  by
          sort(1) and other programs.

       •  LD_LIBRARY_PATH,  LD_PRELOAD,  and  other  LD_*  variables influence the behavior of the dynamic loader/linker.  See also
          ld.so(8).

       •  POSIXLY_CORRECT makes certain programs and library routines follow the prescriptions of POSIX.

       •  The behavior of malloc(3) is influenced by MALLOC_* variables.

       •  The variable HOSTALIASES gives the name of a file containing aliases to be used with gethostbyname(3).

       •  TZ and TZDIR give timezone information used by tzset(3) and through that by functions like  ctime(3),  localtime(3),  mk‐
          time(3), strftime(3).  See also tzselect(8).

       •  TERMCAP gives information on how to address a given terminal (or gives the name of a file containing such information).

       •  COLUMNS and LINES tell applications about the window size, possibly overriding the actual size.

       •  PRINTER or LPDEST may specify the desired printer to use.  See lpr(1).

NOTES
       Historically  and  by standard, environ must be declared in the user program.  However, as a (nonstandard) programmer conve‐
       nience, environ is declared in the header file &lt;unistd.h&gt; if the  _GNU_SOURCE  feature  test  macro  is  defined  (see  fea‐
       ture_test_macros(7)).

       The prctl(2) PR_SET_MM_ENV_START and PR_SET_MM_ENV_END operations can be used to control the location of the process's envi‐
       ronment.

       The HOME, LOGNAME, SHELL, and USER variables are set when the user is changed via a session management interface,  typically
       by  a program such as login(1) from a user database (such as passwd(5)).  (Switching to the root user using su(1) may result
       in a mixed environment where LOGNAME and USER are retained from old user; see the su(1) manual page.)

BUGS
       Clearly there is a security risk here.  Many a system command has been tricked into mischief by a user who specified unusual
       values for IFS or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

       There  is  also the risk of name space pollution.  Programs like make and autoconf allow overriding of default utility names
       from the environment with similarly named variables in all caps.  Thus one uses CC to select the  desired  C  compiler  (and
       similarly  MAKE, AR, AS, FC, LD, LEX, RM, YACC, etc.).  However, in some traditional uses such an environment variable gives
       options for the program instead of a pathname.  Thus, one has MORE and LESS.  Such usage is considered mistaken, and  to  be
       avoided in new programs.
