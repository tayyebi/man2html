NAME
       blkdiscard - discard sectors on a device

SYNOPSIS
       blkdiscard [options] [-o offset] [-l length] device

DESCRIPTION
       blkdiscard is used to discard device sectors. This is useful for solid-state drivers (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.
       Unlike fstrim(8), this command is used directly on the block device.

       By default, blkdiscard will discard all blocks on the device. Options may be used to modify this behavior based on range or
       size, as explained below.

       The device argument is the pathname of the block device.

       WARNING: All data in the discarded region on the device will be lost!

OPTIONS
       The offset and length arguments may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for
       GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB (=1000),
       MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.

       -f, --force
           Disable all checking. Since v2.36 the block device is open in exclusive mode (O_EXCL) by default to avoid collision with
           mounted filesystem or another kernel subsystem. The --force option disables the exclusive access mode.

       -o, --offset offset
           Byte offset into the device from which to start discarding. The provided value must be aligned to the device sector
           size. The default value is zero.

       -l, --length length
           The number of bytes to discard (counting from the starting point). The provided value must be aligned to the device
           sector size. If the specified value extends past the end of the device, blkdiscard will stop at the device size
           boundary. The default value extends to the end of the device.

       -p, --step length
           The number of bytes to discard within one iteration. The default is to discard all by one ioctl call.

       -s, --secure
           Perform a secure discard. A secure discard is the same as a regular discard except that all copies of the discarded
           blocks that were possibly created by garbage collection must also be erased. This requires support from the device.

       -z, --zeroout
           Zero-fill rather than discard.

       -v, --verbose
           Display the aligned values of offset and length. If the --step option is specified, it prints the discard progress every
           second.

       -h, --help
           Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print version and exit.
