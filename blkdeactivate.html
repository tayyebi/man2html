NAME
       blkdeactivate — utility to deactivate block devices

SYNOPSIS
       blkdeactivate [-d dm_options] [-e] [-h] [-l lvm_options] [-m mpath_options] [-r mdraid_options] [-o vdo_options] [-u] [-v]
       [device]

DESCRIPTION
       The blkdeactivate utility deactivates block devices. For mounted block devices, it attempts to unmount it automatically  be‐
       fore  trying  to  deactivate.  The utility currently supports device-mapper devices (DM), including LVM volumes and software
       RAID MD devices. LVM volumes are handled directly using the lvm(8) command, the rest of device-mapper based devices are han‐
       dled using the dmsetup(8) command.  MD devices are handled using the mdadm(8) command.

OPTIONS
       -d|--dmoptions dm_options
              Comma separated list of device-mapper specific options.  Accepted dmsetup(8) options are:

              retry  Retry removal several times in case of failure.

              force  Force device removal.

       -e|--errors
              Show  errors reported from tools called by blkdeactivate. Without this option, any error messages from these external
              tools are suppressed and the blkdeactivate itself provides only a summary message to indicate the device was skipped.

       -h|--help
              Display the help text.

       -l|--lvmoptions lvm_options
              Comma-separated list of LVM specific options:

              retry  Retry removal several times in case of failure.

              wholevg
                     Deactivate the whole LVM Volume Group when processing a Logical Volume.  Deactivating the Volume  Group  as  a
                     whole is quicker than deactivating each Logical Volume separately.

       -r|--mdraidoptions mdraid_options
              Comma-separated list of MD RAID specific options:

              wait   Wait MD device's resync, recovery or reshape action to complete before deactivation.

       -m|--mpathoptions mpath_options
              Comma-separated list of device-mapper multipath specific options:

              disablequeueing
                     Disable  queueing  on  all multipath devices before deactivation.  This avoids a situation where blkdeactivate
                     may end up waiting if all the paths are unavailable for any underlying device-mapper multipath device.

       -o|--vdooptions vdo_options
              Comma-separated list of VDO specific options:

              configfile=file
                     Use specified VDO configuration file.

       -u|--umount
              Unmount a mounted device before trying to deactivate it.  Without this option used, a device that is mounted  is  not
              deactivated.

       -v, --verbose
              Run in verbose mode. Use -vv for even more verbose mode.

EXAMPLES
       Deactivate all supported block devices found in the system, skipping mounted devices.
       # blkdeactivate

       Deactivate all supported block devices found in the system, unmounting any mounted devices first, if possible.
       # blkdeactivate -u

       Deactivate the device /dev/vg/lvol0 together with all its holders, unmounting any mounted devices first, if possible.
       # blkdeactivate -u /dev/vg/lvol0

       Deactivate  all  supported block devices found in the system. If the deactivation of a device-mapper device fails, retry it.
       Deactivate the whole Volume Group at once when processing an LVM Logical Volume.
       # blkdeactivate -u -d retry -l wholevg

       Deactivate all supported block devices found in the system. If the deactivation of a device-mapper device  fails,  retry  it
       and force removal.
       # blkdeactivate -d force,retry
