NAME
       Dpkg::Deps - parse and manipulate dependencies of Debian packages

DESCRIPTION
       The Dpkg::Deps module provides classes implementing various types of dependencies.

       The most important function is deps_parse(), it turns a dependency line in a set of Dpkg::Deps::{Simple,AND,OR,Union}
       objects depending on the case.

FUNCTIONS
       All the deps_* functions are exported by default.

       deps_eval_implication($rel_p, $v_p, $rel_q, $v_q)
           ($rel_p, $v_p) and ($rel_q, $v_q) express two dependencies as (relation, version). The relation variable can have the
           following values that are exported by Dpkg::Version: REL_EQ, REL_LT, REL_LE, REL_GT, REL_GT.

           This functions returns 1 if the "p" dependency implies the "q" dependency. It returns 0 if the "p" dependency implies
           that "q" is not satisfied. It returns undef when there's no implication.

           The $v_p and $v_q parameter should be Dpkg::Version objects.

       $dep = deps_concat(@dep_list)
           This function concatenates multiple dependency lines into a single line, joining them with ", " if appropriate, and
           always returning a valid string.

       $dep = deps_parse($line, %options)
           This function parses the dependency line and returns an object, either a Dpkg::Deps::AND or a Dpkg::Deps::Union. Various
           options can alter the behaviour of that function.

           use_arch (defaults to 1)
               Take into account the architecture restriction part of the dependencies.  Set to 0 to completely ignore that
               information.

           host_arch (defaults to the current architecture)
               Define the host architecture. By default it uses Dpkg::Arch::get_host_arch() to identify the proper architecture.

           build_arch (defaults to the current architecture)
               Define the build architecture. By default it uses Dpkg::Arch::get_build_arch() to identify the proper architecture.

           reduce_arch (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, ignore dependencies that do not concern the current host architecture. This implicitly strips off the
               architecture restriction list so that the resulting dependencies are directly applicable to the current
               architecture.

           use_profiles (defaults to 1)
               Take into account the profile restriction part of the dependencies. Set to 0 to completely ignore that information.

           build_profiles (defaults to no profile)
               Define the active build profiles. By default no profile is defined.

           reduce_profiles (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, ignore dependencies that do not concern the current build profile. This implicitly strips off the
               profile restriction formula so that the resulting dependencies are directly applicable to the current profiles.

           reduce_restrictions (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, ignore dependencies that do not concern the current set of restrictions. This implicitly strips off any
               architecture restriction list or restriction formula so that the resulting dependencies are directly applicable to
               the current restriction.  This currently implies "reduce_arch" and "reduce_profiles", and overrides them if set.

           union (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, returns a Dpkg::Deps::Union instead of a Dpkg::Deps::AND. Use this when parsing non-dependency fields
               like Conflicts.

           virtual (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, allow only virtual package version relations, that is none, or "=".  This should be set whenever
               working with Provides fields.

           build_dep (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, allow build-dep only arch qualifiers, that is ":native".  This should be set whenever working with
               build-deps.

           tests_dep (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, allow tests-specific package names in dependencies, that is "@" and "@builddeps@" (since dpkg 1.18.7).
               This should be set whenever working with dependency fields from debian/tests/control.

       $bool = deps_iterate($deps, $callback_func)
           This function visits all elements of the dependency object, calling the callback function for each element.

           The callback function is expected to return true when everything is fine, or false if something went wrong, in which
           case the iteration will stop.

           Return the same value as the callback function.

       deps_compare($a, $b)
           Implements a comparison operator between two dependency objects.  This function is mainly used to implement the sort()
           method.

CLASSES - Dpkg::Deps::*
       There are several kind of dependencies. A Dpkg::Deps::Simple dependency represents a single dependency statement (it relates
       to one package only).  Dpkg::Deps::Multiple dependencies are built on top of this class and combine several dependencies in
       different manners. Dpkg::Deps::AND represents the logical "AND" between dependencies while Dpkg::Deps::OR represents the
       logical "OR". Dpkg::Deps::Multiple objects can contain Dpkg::Deps::Simple object as well as other Dpkg::Deps::Multiple
       objects.

       In practice, the code is only meant to handle the realistic cases which, given Debian's dependencies structure, imply those
       restrictions: AND can contain Simple or OR objects, OR can only contain Simple objects.

       Dpkg::Deps::KnownFacts is a special class that is used while evaluating dependencies and while trying to simplify them. It
       represents a set of installed packages along with the virtual packages that they might provide.
