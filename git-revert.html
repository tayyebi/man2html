NAME
       git-revert - Revert some existing commits

SYNOPSIS
       git revert [--[no-]edit] [-n] [-m &lt;parent-number&gt;] [-s] [-S[&lt;keyid&gt;]] &lt;commit&gt;...
       git revert (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit)

DESCRIPTION
       Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that
       record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).

       Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one).
       If you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working directory, you should see git-reset(1), particularly the
       --hard option. If you want to extract specific files as they were in another commit, you should see git-restore(1),
       specifically the --source option. Take care with these alternatives as both will discard uncommitted changes in your working
       directory.

       See "Reset, restore and revert" in git(1) for the differences between the three commands.

OPTIONS
       &lt;commit&gt;...
           Commits to revert. For a more complete list of ways to spell commit names, see gitrevisions(7). Sets of commits can also
           be given but no traversal is done by default, see git-rev-list(1) and its --no-walk option.

       -e, --edit
           With this option, git revert will let you edit the commit message prior to committing the revert. This is the default if
           you run the command from a terminal.

       -m parent-number, --mainline parent-number
           Usually you cannot revert a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be considered the mainline.
           This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows revert to reverse the change
           relative to the specified parent.

           Reverting a merge commit declares that you will never want the tree changes brought in by the merge. As a result, later
           merges will only bring in tree changes introduced by commits that are not ancestors of the previously reverted merge.
           This may or may not be what you want.

           See the revert-a-faulty-merge How-To[1] for more details.

       --no-edit
           With this option, git revert will not start the commit message editor.

       --cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;
           This option determines how the commit message will be cleaned up before being passed on to the commit machinery. See
           git-commit(1) for more details. In particular, if the &lt;mode&gt; is given a value of scissors, scissors will be appended to
           MERGE_MSG before being passed on in the case of a conflict.

       -n, --no-commit
           Usually the command automatically creates some commits with commit log messages stating which commits were reverted.
           This flag applies the changes necessary to revert the named commits to your working tree and the index, but does not
           make the commits. In addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD commit. The revert
           is done against the beginning state of your index.

           This is useful when reverting more than one commits' effect to your index in a row.

       -S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign
           GPG-sign commits. The keyid argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck
           to the option without a space.  --no-gpg-sign is useful to countermand both commit.gpgSign configuration variable, and
           earlier --gpg-sign.

       -s, --signoff
           Add a Signed-off-by trailer at the end of the commit message. See the signoff option in git-commit(1) for more
           information.

       --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
           Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once. See the MERGE STRATEGIES section in git-merge(1) for details.

       -X&lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;
           Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the merge strategy. See git-merge(1) for details.

       --rerere-autoupdate, --no-rerere-autoupdate
           After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on the current conflict to update the files in the working tree,
           allow it to also update the index with the result of resolution.  --no-rerere-autoupdate is a good way to double-check
           what rerere did and catch potential mismerges, before committing the result to the index with a separate git add.

       --reference
           Instead of starting the body of the log message with "This reverts &lt;full object name of the commit being reverted&gt;.",
           refer to the commit using "--pretty=reference" format (cf.  git-log(1)). The revert.reference configuration variable can
           be used to enable this option by default.

SEQUENCER SUBCOMMANDS
       --continue
           Continue the operation in progress using the information in .git/sequencer. Can be used to continue after resolving
           conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.

       --skip
           Skip the current commit and continue with the rest of the sequence.

       --quit
           Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used to clear the sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or
           revert.

       --abort
           Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence state.

EXAMPLES
       git revert HEAD~3
           Revert the changes specified by the fourth last commit in HEAD and create a new commit with the reverted changes.

       git revert -n master~5..master~2
           Revert the changes done by commits from the fifth last commit in master (included) to the third last commit in master
           (included), but do not create any commit with the reverted changes. The revert only modifies the working tree and the
           index.

CONFIGURATION
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the git-config(1) documentation. The content is the
       same as whatâ€™s found there:

       revert.reference
           Setting this variable to true makes git revert behave as if the --reference option is given.
