<pre>GIT-CREDENTIAL-STO(1)                                        Git Manual                                       GIT-CREDENTIAL-STO(1)

NAME
       git-credential-store - Helper to store credentials on disk

SYNOPSIS
       git config credential.helper 'store [&lt;options&gt;]'

DESCRIPTION
           Note
           Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on disk, protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is
           not an acceptable security tradeoff, try git-credential-cache(1), or find a helper that integrates with secure storage
           provided by your operating system.

       This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by future Git programs.

       You probably don’t want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to be used as a credential helper by other parts of
       git. See gitcredentials(7) or EXAMPLES below.

OPTIONS
       --file=&lt;path&gt;
           Use &lt;path&gt; to lookup and store credentials. The file will have its filesystem permissions set to prevent other users on
           the system from reading it, but will not be encrypted or otherwise protected. If not specified, credentials will be
           searched for from ~/.git-credentials and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials, and credentials will be written to
           ~/.git-credentials if it exists, or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials if it exists and the former does not. See also the
           section called “FILES”.

FILES
       If not set explicitly with --file, there are two files where git-credential-store will search for credentials in order of
       precedence:

       ~/.git-credentials
           User-specific credentials file.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials
           Second user-specific credentials file. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/credentials will be
           used. Any credentials stored in this file will not be used if ~/.git-credentials has a matching credential as well. It
           is a good idea not to create this file if you sometimes use older versions of Git that do not support it.

       For credential lookups, the files are read in the order given above, with the first matching credential found taking
       precedence over credentials found in files further down the list.

       Credential storage will by default write to the first existing file in the list. If none of these files exist,
       ~/.git-credentials will be created and written to.

       When erasing credentials, matching credentials will be erased from all files.

EXAMPLES
       The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type your username or password. For example:

           $ git config credential.helper store
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           Username: &lt;type your username&gt;
           Password: &lt;type your password&gt;

           [several days later]
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           [your credentials are used automatically]

STORAGE FORMAT
       The .git-credentials file is stored in plaintext. Each credential is stored on its own line as a URL like:

           https://user:pass@example.com

       No other kinds of lines (e.g. empty lines or comment lines) are allowed in the file, even though some may be silently
       ignored. Do not view or edit the file with editors.

       When Git needs authentication for a particular URL context, credential-store will consider that context a pattern to match
       against each entry in the credentials file. If the protocol, hostname, and username (if we already have one) match, then the
       password is returned to Git. See the discussion of configuration in gitcredentials(7) for more information.
