<pre>getipnodebyname(3)                                    Library Functions Manual                                   getipnodebyname(3)

NAME
       getipnodebyname, getipnodebyaddr, freehostent - get network hostnames and addresses

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
       #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

       [[deprecated]] struct hostent *getipnodebyname(const char *name, int af,
                                                   int flags, int *error_num);
       [[deprecated]] struct hostent *getipnodebyaddr(const void addr[.len],
                                                   size_t len, int af,
                                                   int *error_num);
       [[deprecated]] void freehostent(struct hostent *ip);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions are deprecated (and unavailable in glibc).  Use getaddrinfo(3) and getnameinfo(3) instead.

       The getipnodebyname() and getipnodebyaddr() functions return the names and addresses of a network host.  These functions re‐
       turn a pointer to the following structure:

           struct hostent {
               char  *h_name;
               char **h_aliases;
               int    h_addrtype;
               int    h_length;
               char **h_addr_list;
           };

       These functions replace the gethostbyname(3) and gethostbyaddr(3) functions, which could access only the  IPv4  network  ad‐
       dress family.  The getipnodebyname() and getipnodebyaddr() functions can access multiple network address families.

       Unlike the gethostby functions, these functions return pointers to dynamically allocated memory.  The freehostent() function
       is used to release the dynamically allocated memory after the caller no longer needs the hostent structure.

   getipnodebyname() arguments
       The getipnodebyname() function looks up network addresses for the host specified by the  name  argument.   The  af  argument
       specifies one of the following values:

       AF_INET
              The name argument points to a dotted-quad IPv4 address or a name of an IPv4 network host.

       AF_INET6
              The name argument points to a hexadecimal IPv6 address or a name of an IPv6 network host.

       The  flags  argument  specifies  additional options.  More than one option can be specified by bitwise OR-ing them together.
       flags should be set to 0 if no options are desired.

       AI_V4MAPPED
              This flag is used with AF_INET6 to request a query for IPv4 addresses instead of IPv6 addresses; the  IPv4  addresses
              will be mapped to IPv6 addresses.

       AI_ALL This  flag is used with AI_V4MAPPED to request a query for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  Any IPv4 address found will
              be mapped to an IPv6 address.

       AI_ADDRCONFIG
              This flag is used with AF_INET6 to further request that queries for IPv6 addresses should not be made unless the sys‐
              tem  has at least one IPv6 address assigned to a network interface, and that queries for IPv4 addresses should not be
              made unless the system has at least one IPv4 address assigned to a network interface.  This flag may be used  by  it‐
              self or with the AI_V4MAPPED flag.

       AI_DEFAULT
              This flag is equivalent to (AI_ADDRCONFIG | AI_V4MAPPED).

   getipnodebyaddr() arguments
       The  getipnodebyaddr()  function looks up the name of the host whose network address is specified by the addr argument.  The
       af argument specifies one of the following values:

       AF_INET
              The addr argument points to a struct in_addr and len must be set to sizeof(struct in_addr).

       AF_INET6
              The addr argument points to a struct in6_addr and len must be set to sizeof(struct in6_addr).

RETURN VALUE
       NULL is returned if an error occurred, and error_num will contain an error code from the following list:

       HOST_NOT_FOUND
              The hostname or network address was not found.

       NO_ADDRESS
              The domain name server recognized the network address or name, but no answer was returned.  This can  happen  if  the
              network host has only IPv4 addresses and a request has been made for IPv6 information only, or vice versa.

       NO_RECOVERY
              The domain name server returned a permanent failure response.

       TRY_AGAIN
              The domain name server returned a temporary failure response.  You might have better luck next time.

       A successful query returns a pointer to a hostent structure that contains the following fields:

       h_name This is the official name of this network host.

       h_aliases
              This is an array of pointers to unofficial aliases for the same host.  The array is terminated by a null pointer.

       h_addrtype
              This  is  a  copy of the af argument to getipnodebyname() or getipnodebyaddr().  h_addrtype will always be AF_INET if
              the af argument was AF_INET.  h_addrtype will always be AF_INET6 if the af argument was AF_INET6.

       h_length
              This field will be set to sizeof(struct in_addr) if h_addrtype is AF_INET, and to sizeof(struct in6_addr) if  h_addr‐
              type is AF_INET6.

       h_addr_list
              This is an array of one or more pointers to network address structures for the network host.  The array is terminated
              by a null pointer.

STANDARDS
       RFC 2553.

NOTES
       These functions were present in glibc 2.1.91-95, but were removed again.  Several UNIX-like systems support  them,  but  all
       call them deprecated.
