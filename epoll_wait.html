<pre>epoll_wait(2)                                           System Calls Manual                                           epoll_wait(2)

NAME
       epoll_wait, epoll_pwait, epoll_pwait2 - wait for an I/O event on an epoll file descriptor

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/epoll.h&gt;

       int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events,
                      int maxevents, int timeout);
       int epoll_pwait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events,
                      int maxevents, int timeout,
                      const sigset_t *_Nullable sigmask);
       int epoll_pwait2(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events,
                      int maxevents, const struct timespec *_Nullable timeout,
                      const sigset_t *_Nullable sigmask);

DESCRIPTION
       The  epoll_wait() system call waits for events on the epoll(7) instance referred to by the file descriptor epfd.  The buffer
       pointed to by events is used to return information from the ready list about file descriptors in the interest list that have
       some events available.  Up to maxevents are returned by epoll_wait().  The maxevents argument must be greater than zero.

       The  timeout  argument  specifies  the  number  of  milliseconds that epoll_wait() will block.  Time is measured against the
       CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock.

       A call to epoll_wait() will block until either:

       •  a file descriptor delivers an event;

       •  the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or

       •  the timeout expires.

       Note that the timeout interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling  delays  mean  that
       the  blocking interval may overrun by a small amount.  Specifying a timeout of -1 causes epoll_wait() to block indefinitely,
       while specifying a timeout equal to zero cause epoll_wait() to return immediately, even if no events are available.

       The struct epoll_event is described in epoll_event(3type).

       The data field of each returned epoll_event structure contains the same data as was specified in the  most  recent  call  to
       epoll_ctl(2) (EPOLL_CTL_ADD, EPOLL_CTL_MOD) for the corresponding open file descriptor.

       The  events  field  is  a bit mask that indicates the events that have occurred for the corresponding open file description.
       See epoll_ctl(2) for a list of the bits that may appear in this mask.

   epoll_pwait()
       The relationship between epoll_wait() and epoll_pwait() is analogous to the relationship between select(2)  and  pselect(2):
       like  pselect(2), epoll_pwait() allows an application to safely wait until either a file descriptor becomes ready or until a
       signal is caught.

       The following epoll_pwait() call:

           ready = epoll_pwait(epfd, &amp;events, maxevents, timeout, &amp;sigmask);

       is equivalent to atomically executing the following calls:

           sigset_t origmask;

           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;sigmask, &amp;origmask);
           ready = epoll_wait(epfd, &amp;events, maxevents, timeout);
           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;origmask, NULL);

       The sigmask argument may be specified as NULL, in which case epoll_pwait() is equivalent to epoll_wait().

   epoll_pwait2()
       The epoll_pwait2() system call is equivalent to epoll_pwait() except for the timeout argument.  It takes an argument of type
       timespec  to  be  able  to  specify  nanosecond  resolution  timeout.  This argument functions the same as in pselect(2) and
       ppoll(2).  If timeout is NULL, then epoll_pwait2() can block indefinitely.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, epoll_wait() returns the number of file descriptors ready for the requested I/O, or zero if no  file  descriptor
       became  ready  during  the requested timeout milliseconds.  On failure, epoll_wait() returns -1 and errno is set to indicate
       the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  epfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT The memory area pointed to by events is not accessible with write permissions.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal handler before either (1) any of the requested events occurred or (2) the  time‐
              out expired; see signal(7).

       EINVAL epfd is not an epoll file descriptor, or maxevents is less than or equal to zero.

VERSIONS
       epoll_wait() was added in Linux 2.6.  Library support is provided in glibc 2.3.2.

       epoll_pwait() was added in Linux 2.6.19.  Library support is provided in glibc 2.6.

       epoll_pwait2() was added in Linux 5.11.

STANDARDS
       epoll_wait(), epoll_pwait(), and epoll_pwait2() are Linux-specific.

NOTES
       While  one  thread  is  blocked in a call to epoll_wait(), it is possible for another thread to add a file descriptor to the
       waited-upon epoll instance.  If the new file descriptor becomes ready, it will cause the epoll_wait() call to unblock.

       If more than maxevents file descriptors are ready when epoll_wait() is called, then successive epoll_wait() calls will round
       robin  through  the set of ready file descriptors.  This behavior helps avoid starvation scenarios, where a process fails to
       notice that additional file descriptors are ready because it focuses on a set of file descriptors that are already known  to
       be ready.

       Note that it is possible to call epoll_wait() on an epoll instance whose interest list is currently empty (or whose interest
       list becomes empty because file descriptors are closed or removed from the interest in another thread).  The call will block
       until some file descriptor is later added to the interest list (in another thread) and that file descriptor becomes ready.

   C library/kernel differences
       The  raw epoll_pwait() and epoll_pwait2() system calls have a sixth argument, size_t sigsetsize, which specifies the size in
       bytes of the sigmask argument.  The glibc epoll_pwait() wrapper function specifies this argument as a fixed value (equal  to
       sizeof(sigset_t)).

BUGS
       Before Linux 2.6.37, a timeout value larger than approximately LONG_MAX / HZ milliseconds is treated as -1 (i.e., infinity).
       Thus, for example, on a system where sizeof(long) is 4 and the kernel HZ value is 1000, this  means  that  timeouts  greater
       than 35.79 minutes are treated as infinity.
