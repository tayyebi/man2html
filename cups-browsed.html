NAME
       cups-browsed - A daemon for browsing the Bonjour broadcasts of shared, remote CUPS printers

SYNOPSIS
       cups-browsed [-v | -d | --debug] [-c config-file]
       [-o option=value] [-o 'config file line'] ...
       [--autoshutdown=mode] [--autoshutdown-timeout=timeout]
       [-h | --help | --version]

DESCRIPTION
       cups-browsed has four independently switchable functions:

       1.  Browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove local raw queues pointing to these printers.

       2.  Browse CUPS broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove local raw queues pointing to these printers.

       3.  Browse an LDAP server for printers and create/remove local raw queues pointing to these printers.

       4.  Broadcast local queues with the CUPS protocol.

       Note  that 2. and 4. are only to allow communication with legacy CUPS servers (1.5.x or older) on the remote machine(s). The
       standard method to broadcast for shared/network printers to  broadcast  their  presence  is  Bonjour.  The  CUPS  broadcast‐
       ing/browsing protocol is deprecated.

       cups-browsed can be run permanently (from system boot to shutdown) or on-demand (for example to save resources on mobile de‐
       vices). For running it on-demand an auto-shutdown feature can be activated to let cups-browsed terminate when  it  does  not
       have queues any more to take care of.

OPTIONS
       -v, -d, --debug
              Debug mode, verbose logging to stderr

       -l, --logfile
              Debug logging into /var/log/cups-browsed/cups-browsed_log file.

       -c config-file
              Uses the alternative configuration file config-file instead of the standard one.

       -o option=value, -o 'config file line'
              Supply  configuration options via the command line. You can supply any line which also could be put into the configu‐
              ration file, but note that due to the spaces the line has to be put into quotes, or for a simple key/value  pair  the
              space  between key and value can get replaced by '='. If command-line-supplied configuration settings are contradict‐
              ing with the ones in the configuration file, the ones in the configuration file will get used.

       --autoshutdown=mode
              Auto shutdown mode, mode is off for no auto shutdown, on for auto shutdown being active, and avahi for control by the
              avahi-daemon  being  run on-demand, getting auto-shutdown turned off while avahi-daemon is present and on when avahi-
              daemon is shut down.

       --autoshutdown-on=inactivity-type
              What cups-browsed considers as inactivity for auto-shutdown. inactivity-type set to  no-queues  (the  default)  means
              that  auto-shutdown  is initiated if there are no queues generated by cups-browsed any more, no-jobs means that auto-
              shutdown will get initiated if all queues generated by cups-browsed are without jobs.

       --autoshutdown-timeout=timeout
              timeout tells after how many seconds cups-browsed should shut down if it has no local queues set up for  any  discov‐
              ered remote printer any more or jobs on these. Default is 30 seconds. 0 means immediate shutdown.

       -h, --help, --version
              Display usage and version info and do not start the daemon.

FILES
       /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf

SIGNALS
       SIGINT, SIGTERM: cups-browsed will shutdown.

       SIGUSR1: Switches cups-browsed into permanent mode (no auto shutdown).

       SIGUSR2: Switches cups-browsed into auto shutdown mode.

NOTES
       Please  take  references to cups 1.6.x to include newer versions.  Similarly, cups 1.5.x is intended to encompass older ver‐
       sions too.

       In environments with only cups 1.6.x servers and clients (plus cups-browsed on either server or client or both) the function
       described  in  1.   enables the automatic discovery of remote queues and their display in printing dialogues of applications
       and with command line tools.

       The facility provided by 3. allows printers that are registered in an LDAP server to be added as local queues. CUPS  servers
       1.5.x  are  able to automatically register printers in LDAP. The facility provided by cups-browsed allows a filter string to
       further limit the printers that are browsed from LDAP.

       The facility provided by 4. means that servers running cups 1.6.x plus cups-browsed can broadcast their local queues so that
       clients  with cups 1.5.x get these queues automatically available. The outcome of 2. is that clients running cups 1.6.x plus
       cups-browsed can use the CUPS broadcasts from servers with cups 1.5.x. As with browsing of Bonjour broadcasts,  the  created
       local raw queues are available to applications and command line tools.
