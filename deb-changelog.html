<pre>deb-changelog(5)                                             dpkg suite                                            deb-changelog(5)

NAME
       deb-changelog - dpkg source packages' changelog file format

SYNOPSIS
       debian/changelog

DESCRIPTION
       Changes in the packaged version of a project are explained in the changelog file debian/changelog.  This includes
       modifications made in the source package compared to the upstream one as well as other changes and updates to the package.

       The format of the debian/changelog allows the package building tools to discover which version of the package is being built
       and find out other release-specific information.

       That format is a series of entries like this:

        package (version) distributions; metadata
                 [optional blank line(s), stripped]
         * change-details
           more-change-details
                 [blank line(s), included in dpkg-parsechangelog(1) output]
         * even-more-change-details
                 [optional blank line(s), stripped]
         -- maintainer-name &lt;email-address&gt;  date

       package and version are the source package name and version number.  version is delimited by parenthesis U+00028 ‘(’ and
       U+0029 ‘)’.

       distributions lists one or more space-separated distributions where this version should be installed when it is uploaded; it
       is copied to the Distribution field in the .changes file.  distributions must be terminated by a semicolon (U+003B ‘;’).

       metadata lists zero or more comma-separated keyword=value items.  Each keyword can contain only minus and case insensitive
       alphanumeric characters, as they need to be mapped to deb822(5) field names.  The only keywords currently supported by dpkg
       are urgency and binary-only.  urgency's value is used for the Urgency field in the .changes file for the upload.  binary-
       only with a yes value, is used to denote that this changelog entry is for a binary-only non-maintainer upload (an automatic
       binary rebuild with the only change being the changelog entry).

       The change details may in fact be any series of lines starting with at least two spaces (U+0020 SPACE), but conventionally
       each change starts with an asterisk and a separating space and continuation lines are indented so as to bring them in line
       with the start of the text above.  Blank lines may be used here to separate groups of changes, if desired.

       If this upload resolves bugs recorded in the distribution bug tracking system, they may be automatically closed on the
       inclusion of this package into the distribution archive by including the string:

           Closes: #nnnnn

       in the change details, where #nnnnn is the bug number.  The exact Perl regular expression is:

           /closes:\s*(?:bug)?\#?\s?\d+(?:,\s*(?:bug)?\#?\s?\d+)*/i

       That is, the string should consist of the word closes: followed by a comma-separated list of bug numbers.  Bug numbers may
       be preceded by the word bug and/or a # sign, as in "Closes: 42, bug#43, #44, bug 45".  The words closes: and bug are not
       case sensitive.  The list of bug numbers may span multiple lines.

       This information is conveyed via the Closes field in the .changes file.  Where, depending on the archive maintenance
       software, all the bug numbers listed might get automatically closed.

       The maintainer name and email address used in the changelog should be the details of the person who prepared this release of
       the package.  They are not necessarily those of the uploader or usual package maintainer.  The information here will be
       copied to the Changed-By field in the .changes file, and then later might be used to send an acknowledgment when the upload
       has been installed in the distribution archive.

       The date has the following format (compatible and with the same semantics of RFC2822 and RFC5322, or what «date -R»
       generates):

           day-of-week, dd month yyyy hh:mm:ss +zzzz

       where:

       day-of-week
           Is one of: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.

       dd  Is a one- or two-digit day of the month (01-31), where the leading zero is optional, but conventionally does not get
           omitted.

       month
           Is one of: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.

       yyyy
           Is the four-digit year (e.g. 2010).

       hh  Is the two-digit hour (00-23).

       mm  Is the two-digit minutes (00-59).

       ss  Is the two-digit seconds (00-60).

       [+-]zzzz
           Is the time zone offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  ‘+’ indicates that the time is ahead of (i.e., east of)
           UTC and ‘-’ indicates that the time is behind (i.e., west of) UTC.  The first two digits indicate the hour difference
           from UTC and the last two digits indicate the number of additional minutes difference from UTC.  The last two digits
           must be in the range 00-59.

       The first “title” line with the package name must start at the left hand margin.  The “trailer” line with the maintainer and
       date details must be preceded by exactly one space (U+0020 SPACE).  The maintainer details and the date must be separated by
       exactly two spaces (U+0020 SPACE).  Each part of the date can be separated by one or more spaces (U+0020 SPACE), except
       after the comma where it can be separated by zero or more spaces (U+0020 SPACE).

       Any line that consists entirely (i.e., no leading whitespace) of # or /* */ style comments or RCS keywords.

       Vim modelines or Emacs local variables, and ancient changelog entries with other formats at the end of the file should be
       accepted and preserved on output, but their contents might be otherwise ignored and parsing stopped at that point.

       The entire changelog must be encoded in UTF-8.

EXAMPLES
        dpkg (1.17.18) unstable; urgency=low

         [ Guillem Jover ]
         * Handle empty minimum versions when initializing dependency versions,
           as the code is mapping the minimum version 0 to '' to avoid outputting
           useless versions. Regression introduced in dpkg 1.17.17. Closes: #764929

         [ Updated programs translations ]
         * Catalan (Guillem Jover).

         [ Updated dselect translations ]
         * Catalan (Guillem Jover).
         * German (Sven Joachim).
