              dotnet pack -h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       The  dotnet pack command builds the project and creates NuGet packages.  The result of this command is a NuGet package (that
       is, a .nupkg file).

       If you want to generate a package that contains the debug symbols, you have two options available:

       • --include-symbols - it creates the symbols package.

       • --include-source - it creates the symbols package with a src folder inside containing the source files.

       NuGet dependencies of the packed project are added to the .nuspec file, so they’re properly resolved when the package is in‐
       stalled.   If the packed project has references to other projects, the other projects are not included in the package.  Cur‐
       rently, you must have a package per project if you have project-to-project dependencies.

       By default, dotnet pack builds the project first.  If you wish to avoid this behavior, pass the --no-build option.  This op‐
       tion is often useful in Continuous Integration (CI) build scenarios where you know the code was previously built.

              In some cases, the implicit build cannot be performed.  This can occur when GeneratePackageOnBuild is set, to avoid a
              cyclic dependency between build and pack targets.  The build can also fail if there is a locked file or other issue.

       You can provide MSBuild properties to the dotnet pack command for the packing process.  For more information, see NuGet pack
       target properties and the MSBuild Command-Line Reference.  The Examples section shows how to use the MSBuild -p switch for a
       couple of different scenarios.

              Web projects aren’t packable.

   Implicit restore
       You don’t have to run dotnet restore because it’s run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to  occur,  such  as
       dotnet  new,  dotnet  build, dotnet run, dotnet test, dotnet publish, and dotnet pack.  To disable implicit restore, use the
       --no-restore option.

       The dotnet restore command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring makes sense, such  as  continuous
       integration builds in Azure DevOps Services or in build systems that need to explicitly control when the restore occurs.

       For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the dotnet restore documentation.

       This  command supports the dotnet restore options when passed in the long form (for example, --source).  Short form options,
       such as -s, are not supported.

   Workload manifest downloads
       When you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads.  If  the
       download  is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped.  For more information, see Advertising mani‐
       fests.

ARGUMENTS
       PROJECT | SOLUTION

       The project or solution to pack.  It’s either a path to a csproj, vbproj, or fsproj file, or to a solution file or  directo‐
       ry.  If not specified, the command searches the current directory for a project or solution file.

OPTIONS
       • -c|--configuration &lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;

         Defines  the  build  configuration.   The default for most projects is Debug, but you can override the build configuration
         settings in your project.

       • --force

         Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful.  Specifying  this  flag  is  the  same  as
         deleting the project.assets.json file.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --include-source

         Includes  the debug symbols NuGet packages in addition to the regular NuGet packages in the output directory.  The sources
         files are included in the src folder within the symbols package.

       • --include-symbols

         Includes the debug symbols NuGet packages in addition to the regular NuGet packages in the output directory.

       • --interactive

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.   Available  since
         .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

       • --no-build

         Doesn’t build the project before packing.  It also implicitly sets the --no-restore flag.

       • --no-dependencies

         Ignores project-to-project references and only restores the root project.

       • --no-restore

         Doesn’t execute an implicit restore when running the command.

       • --nologo

         Doesn’t display the startup banner or the copyright message.

       • -o|--output &lt;OUTPUT_DIRECTORY&gt;

         Places the built packages in the directory specified.

       • --runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;

         Specifies the target runtime to restore packages for.  For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog.

       • -s|--serviceable

         Sets  the  serviceable  flag in the package.  For more information, see .NET Blog: .NET Framework 4.5.1 Supports Microsoft
         Security Updates for .NET NuGet Libraries (https://aka.ms/nupkgservicing).

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets the verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed],  and  diag[nostic].
         For more information, see &lt;xref:Microsoft.Build.Framework.LoggerVerbosity&gt;.

       • --version-suffix &lt;VERSION_SUFFIX&gt;

         Defines  the  value for the VersionSuffix MSBuild property.  The effect of this property on the package version depends on
         the values of the Version and VersionPrefix properties, as shown in the following table:

         Properties with values            Package version
         ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
         None                              1.0.0
         Version                           $(Version)
         VersionPrefix only                $(VersionPrefix)
         VersionSuffix only                1.0.0-$(VersionSuffix)
         VersionPrefix and VersionSuffix   $(VersionPrefix)-$(VersionSuffix)

         If you want to use --version-suffix, specify VersionPrefix and not Version in the project file.  For example, if  Version‐
         Prefix is 0.1.2 and you pass --version-suffix rc.1 to dotnet pack, the package version will be 0.1.2-rc.1.

         If Version has a value and you pass --version-suffix to dotnet pack, the value specified for --version-suffix is ignored.

EXAMPLES
       • Pack the project in the current directory:

                dotnet pack

       • Pack the app1 project:

                dotnet pack ~/projects/app1/project.csproj

       • Pack the project in the current directory and place the resulting packages into the nupkgs folder:

                dotnet pack --output nupkgs

       • Pack the project in the current directory into the nupkgs folder and skip the build step:

                dotnet pack --no-build --output nupkgs

       • With  the project’s version suffix configured as &lt;VersionSuffix&gt;$(VersionSuffix)&lt;/VersionSuffix&gt; in the .csproj file, pack
         the current project and update the resulting package version with the given suffix:

                dotnet pack --version-suffix "ci-1234"

       • Set the package version to 2.1.0 with the PackageVersion MSBuild property:

                dotnet pack -p:PackageVersion=2.1.0

       • Pack the project for a specific target framework:

                dotnet pack -p:TargetFrameworks=net45

       • Pack the project and use a specific runtime (Windows 10) for the restore operation:

                dotnet pack --runtime win10-x64

       • Pack the project using a .nuspec file:

                dotnet pack ~/projects/app1/project.csproj -p:NuspecFile=~/projects/app1/project.nuspec -p:NuspecBasePath=~/projects/app1/nuget
