NAME
       Dpkg::BuildOptions - parse and update build options

DESCRIPTION
       This class can be used to manipulate options stored in environment variables like DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS and
       DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS.

METHODS
       $bo = Dpkg::BuildOptions-&gt;new(%opts)
           Create a new Dpkg::BuildOptions object. It will be initialized based on the value of the environment variable named
           $opts{envvar} (or DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS if that option is not set).

       $bo-&gt;reset()
           Reset the object to not have any option (it's empty).

       $bo-&gt;merge($content, $source)
           Merge the options set in $content and record that they come from the source $source. $source is mainly used in warning
           messages currently to indicate where invalid options have been detected.

           $content is a space separated list of options with optional assigned values like "nocheck parallel=2".

       $bo-&gt;set($option, $value, [$source])
           Store the given option in the object with the given value. It's legitimate for a value to be undefined if the option is
           a simple boolean (its presence means true, its absence means false). The $source is optional and indicates where the
           option comes from.

           The known options have their values checked for sanity. Options without values have their value removed and options with
           invalid values are discarded.

       $bo-&gt;get($option)
           Return the value associated to the option. It might be undef even if the option exists. You might want to check with
           $bo-&gt;has($option) to verify if the option is stored in the object.

       $bo-&gt;has($option)
           Returns a boolean indicating whether the option is stored in the object.

       $bo-&gt;parse_features($option, $use_feature)
           Parse the $option values, as a set of known features to enable or disable, as specified in the $use_feature hash
           reference.

           Each feature is prefixed with a '+' or a '-' character as a marker to enable or disable it. The special feature "all"
           can be used to act on all known features.

           Unknown or malformed features will emit warnings.

       $string = $bo-&gt;output($fh)
           Return a string representation of the build options suitable to be assigned to an environment variable. Can optionally
           output that string to the given filehandle.

       $bo-&gt;export([$var])
           Export the build options to the given environment variable. If omitted, the environment variable defined at creation
           time is assumed. The value set to the variable is also returned.

CHANGES
   Version 1.02 (dpkg 1.18.19)
       New method: $bo-&gt;parse_features().

   Version 1.01 (dpkg 1.16.1)
       Enable to use another environment variable instead of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  Thus add support for the "envvar" option at
       creation time.

   Version 1.00 (dpkg 1.15.6)
       Mark the module as public.

1.21.21                                                      2023-03-02                                   Dpkg::BuildOptions(3perl)
