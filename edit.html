NAME
       run-mailcap, view, see, edit, compose, print - execute programs via entries in the mailcap file

SYNOPSIS
       run-mailcap --action=ACTION [--option[=value]] [MIME-TYPE:[ENCODING:]]FILE [...]

       The  see,  edit, compose and print versions are just aliases that default to the view, edit, compose, and print actions (re‐
       spectively).

DESCRIPTION
       run-mailcap (or any of its aliases) will use the given action to process each mime-type/file in turn.  Each file  is  speci‐
       fied  as  its  mime-type,  its encoding (e.g. compression), and filename together, separated by colons.  If the mime-type is
       omitted, an attempt to determine the type is made by trying to match the file's  extension  with  those  in  the  mime.types
       files.  If no mime-type is found, a last attempt will be done by running the file command, if available.  If the encoding is
       omitted, it will also be determined from the file's extensions.  Currently supported encodings are gzip (.gz), bzip2 (.bz2),
       xz  (.xz),  and  compress (.Z).  A filename of "-" can be used to mean "standard input", but then a mime-type must be speci‐
       fied.

       Both the user's files (~/.mailcap; ~/.mime.types) and the system files (/etc/mailcap; /etc/mime.types) are searched in  turn
       for information.

   EXAMPLES
         see picture.jpg
         print output.ps.gz
         compose text/html:index.htm
         extract-mail-attachment msg.txt | see image/tiff:gzip:-

   OPTIONS
       All options are in the form --&lt;opt&gt;=&lt;value&gt;.

       --action=&lt;action&gt;
              Performs  the  specified action on the files.  Valid actions are view, cat (uses only "copiousoutput" rules and sends
              output to STDOUT) , compose, composetyped, edit and print.  If no action is specified, the action will be  determined
              by how the program was called.

       --debug
              Turns on extra information to find out what is happening.

       --nopager
              Ignores any "copiousoutput" directive and sends output to STDOUT.

       --norun
              Displays the found command without actually executing it.

SECURITY
       A  temporary  symbolic  link  to  the  file  is  opened  if  the  file  name  matches  the  Perl regular expression "[^[:al‐
       num:],.:/@%^+=_-]", in order to protect from the injection of shell commands, and to make sure that the name can  always  be
       displayed  in  the current locale.  In addition, the file is opened using its absolute path to prevent the injection of com‐
       mand-line arguments, for instance using file names starting with dashes.
