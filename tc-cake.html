DESCRIPTION
       CAKE  (Common  Applications  Kept  Enhanced)  is a shaping-capable queue discipline which uses both AQM and FQ.  It combines
       COBALT, which is an AQM algorithm combining Codel and BLUE, a shaper which operates in deficit mode, and a variant of  DRR++
       for  flow  isolation.   8-way  set-associative  hashing is used to virtually eliminate hash collisions.  Priority queuing is
       available through a simplified diffserv implementation.  Overhead compensation for various encapsulation schemes is  tightly
       integrated.

       All settings are optional; the default settings are chosen to be sensible in most common deployments.  Most people will only
       need to set the bandwidth parameter to get useful results, but reading the Overhead Compensation and Round  Trip  Time  sec‐
       tions is strongly encouraged.

SHAPER PARAMETERS
       CAKE uses a deficit-mode shaper, which does not exhibit the initial burst typical of token-bucket shapers.  It will automat‐
       ically burst precisely as much as required to maintain the configured throughput.  As such, it is  very  straightforward  to
       configure.

       unlimited (default)
            No limit on the bandwidth.

       bandwidth RATE
            Set the shaper bandwidth.  See tc(8) or examples below for details of the RATE value.

       autorate-ingress
            Automatic  capacity estimation based on traffic arriving at this qdisc.  This is most likely to be useful with cellular
       links, which tend to change quality randomly.  A bandwidth parameter can be used in conjunction to specify an initial  esti‐
       mate.  The shaper will periodically be set to a bandwidth slightly below the estimated rate.  This estimator cannot estimate
       the bandwidth of links downstream of itself.

OVERHEAD COMPENSATION PARAMETERS
       The size of each packet on the wire may differ from that seen by Linux.  The following parameters allow CAKE  to  compensate
       for  this  difference by internally considering each packet to be bigger than Linux informs it.  To assist users who are not
       expert network engineers, keywords have been provided to represent a number of common link technologies.

   Manual Overhead Specification
       overhead BYTES
            Adds BYTES to the size of each packet.  BYTES may be negative; values between -64 and 256 (inclusive) are accepted.

       mpu BYTES
            Rounds each packet (including overhead) up to a minimum length BYTES. BYTES may not be negative; values between  0  and
       256 (inclusive) are accepted.

       atm
            Compensates  for ATM cell framing, which is normally found on ADSL links.  This is performed after the overhead parame‐
       ter above.  ATM uses fixed 53-byte cells, each of which can carry 48 bytes payload.

       ptm
            Compensates for PTM encoding, which is normally found on VDSL2 links and uses a 64b/65b encoding  scheme.  It  is  even
       more  efficient  to  simply derate the specified shaper bandwidth by a factor of 64/65 or 0.984. See ITU G.992.3 Annex N and
       IEEE 802.3 Section 61.3 for details.

       noatm
            Disables ATM and PTM compensation.

   Failsafe Overhead Keywords
       These two keywords are provided for quick-and-dirty setup.  Use them if you can't be bothered to read the rest of this  sec‐
       tion.

       raw (default)
            Turns off all overhead compensation in CAKE.  The packet size reported by Linux will be used directly.

            Other overhead keywords may be added after "raw".  The effect of this is to make the overhead compensation operate rel‐
       ative to the reported packet size, not the underlying IP packet size.

       conservative
            Compensates for more overhead than is likely to occur on any widely-deployed link technology.
            Equivalent to overhead 48 atm.

   ADSL Overhead Keywords
       Most ADSL modems have a way to check which framing scheme is in use.  Often this is also specified in the settings  document
       provided  by  the  ISP.   The keywords in this section are intended to correspond with these sources of information.  All of
       them implicitly set the atm flag.

       pppoa-vcmux
            Equivalent to overhead 10 atm

       pppoa-llc
            Equivalent to overhead 14 atm

       pppoe-vcmux
            Equivalent to overhead 32 atm

       pppoe-llcsnap
            Equivalent to overhead 40 atm

       bridged-vcmux
            Equivalent to overhead 24 atm

       bridged-llcsnap
            Equivalent to overhead 32 atm

       ipoa-vcmux
            Equivalent to overhead 8 atm

       ipoa-llcsnap
            Equivalent to overhead 16 atm

       See also the Ethernet Correction Factors section below.

   VDSL2 Overhead Keywords
       ATM was dropped from VDSL2 in favour of PTM, which is a much more straightforward framing scheme.  Some ISPs retained  PPPoE
       for compatibility with their existing back-end systems.

       pppoe-ptm
            Equivalent to overhead 30 ptm

            PPPoE: 2B PPP + 6B PPPoE +
            ETHERNET: 6B dest MAC + 6B src MAC + 2B ethertype + 4B Frame Check Sequence +
            PTM: 1B Start of Frame (S) + 1B End of Frame (Ck) + 2B TC-CRC (PTM-FCS)

       bridged-ptm
            Equivalent to overhead 22 ptm
            ETHERNET: 6B dest MAC + 6B src MAC + 2B ethertype + 4B Frame Check Sequence +
            PTM: 1B Start of Frame (S) + 1B End of Frame (Ck) + 2B TC-CRC (PTM-FCS)

       See also the Ethernet Correction Factors section below.

   DOCSIS Cable Overhead Keyword
       DOCSIS is the universal standard for providing Internet service over cable-TV infrastructure.

       In this case, the actual on-wire overhead is less important than the packet size the head-end equipment uses for shaping and
       metering.  This is specified to be an Ethernet frame including the CRC (aka FCS).

       docsis
            Equivalent to overhead 18 mpu 64 noatm

   Ethernet Overhead Keywords
       ethernet
            Accounts for Ethernet's preamble, inter-frame gap, and Frame Check Sequence.  Use this keyword when the bottleneck  be‐
       ing shaped for is an actual Ethernet cable.
            Equivalent to overhead 38 mpu 84 noatm

       ether-vlan
            Adds  4  bytes  to  the overhead compensation, accounting for an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN header appended to the Ethernet frame
       header.  NB: Some ISPs use one or even two of these within PPPoE; this keyword may be repeated as necessary to express this.

ROUND TRIP TIME PARAMETERS
       Active Queue Management (AQM) consists of embedding congestion signals in the packet flow, which receivers use  to  instruct
       senders  to  slow  down  when the queue is persistently occupied.  CAKE uses ECN signalling when available, and packet drops
       otherwise, according to a combination of the Codel and BLUE AQM algorithms called COBALT.

       Very short latencies require a very rapid AQM response to adequately control latency.  However, such a rapid response  tends
       to  impair  throughput when the actual RTT is relatively long.  CAKE allows specifying the RTT it assumes for tuning various
       parameters.  Actual RTTs within an order of magnitude of this will generally work well for both throughput and latency  man‐
       agement.

       At  the  'lan'  setting  and below, the time constants are similar in magnitude to the jitter in the Linux kernel itself, so
       congestion might be signalled prematurely. The flows will then become sparse and total throughput reduced, leaving little or
       no  back-pressure  for  the  fairness logic to work against. Use the "metro" setting for local lans unless you have a custom
       kernel.

       rtt TIME
            Manually specify an RTT.

       datacentre
            For extremely high-performance 10GigE+ networks only.  Equivalent to rtt 100us.

       lan
            For pure Ethernet (not Wi-Fi) networks, at home or in the office.  Don't use this when shaping for an  Internet  access
       link.  Equivalent to rtt 1ms.

       metro
            For traffic mostly within a single city.  Equivalent to rtt 10ms.

       regional
            For traffic mostly within a European-sized country.  Equivalent to rtt 30ms.

       internet (default)
            This is suitable for most Internet traffic.  Equivalent to rtt 100ms.

       oceanic
            For Internet traffic with generally above-average latency, such as that suffered by Australasian residents.  Equivalent
       to rtt 300ms.

       satellite
            For traffic via geostationary satellites.  Equivalent to rtt 1000ms.

       interplanetary
            So named because Jupiter is about 1 light-hour from Earth.  Use  this  to  (almost)  completely  disable  AQM  actions.
       Equivalent to rtt 3600s.

FLOW ISOLATION PARAMETERS
       With  flow  isolation enabled, CAKE places packets from different flows into different queues, each of which carries its own
       AQM state.  Packets from each queue are then delivered fairly, according to a DRR++ algorithm which  minimizes  latency  for
       "sparse" flows.  CAKE uses a set-associative hashing algorithm to minimize flow collisions.

       These  keywords  specify whether fairness based on source address, destination address, individual flows, or any combination
       of those is desired.

       flowblind
            Disables flow isolation; all traffic passes through a single queue for each tin.

       srchost
            Flows are defined only by source address.  Could be useful on the egress path of an ISP backhaul.

       dsthost
            Flows are defined only by destination address.  Could be useful on the ingress path of an ISP backhaul.

       hosts
            Flows are defined by source-destination host pairs.  This is host isolation, rather than flow isolation.

       flows
            Flows are defined by the entire 5-tuple of source address, destination address, transport  protocol,  source  port  and
       destination port.  This is the type of flow isolation performed by SFQ and fq_codel.

       dual-srchost
            Flows  are  defined  by  the  5-tuple, and fairness is applied first over source addresses, then over individual flows.
       Good for use on egress traffic from a LAN to the internet, where it'll prevent any one LAN host from  monopolising  the  up‐
       link, regardless of the number of flows they use.

       dual-dsthost
            Flows are defined by the 5-tuple, and fairness is applied first over destination addresses, then over individual flows.
       Good for use on ingress traffic to a LAN from the internet, where it'll prevent any one LAN host from monopolising the down‐
       link, regardless of the number of flows they use.

       triple-isolate (default)
            Flows  are  defined  by the 5-tuple, and fairness is applied over source *and* destination addresses intelligently (ie.
       not merely by host-pairs), and also over individual flows.  Use this if you're not certain whether to  use  dual-srchost  or
       dual-dsthost;  it'll  do both jobs at once, preventing any one host on *either* side of the link from monopolising it with a
       large number of flows.

       nat
            Instructs Cake to perform a NAT lookup before applying flow-isolation rules, to determine the true addresses  and  port
       numbers  of  the packet, to improve fairness between hosts "inside" the NAT.  This has no practical effect in "flowblind" or
       "flows" modes, or if NAT is performed on a different host.

       nonat (default)
            Cake will not perform a NAT lookup.  Flow isolation will be performed using the addresses  and  port  numbers  directly
       visible to the interface Cake is attached to.

PRIORITY QUEUE PARAMETERS
       CAKE  can  divide  traffic  into "tins" based on the Diffserv field.  Each tin has its own independent set of flow-isolation
       queues, and is serviced based on a WRR algorithm.  To avoid perverse Diffserv marking incentives, tin weights have a "prior‐
       ity  sharing"  value when bandwidth used by that tin is below a threshold, and a lower "bandwidth sharing" value when above.
       Bandwidth is compared against the threshold using the same algorithm as the deficit-mode shaper.

       Detailed customisation of tin parameters is not provided.  The following presets perform all necessary tuning,  relative  to
       the current shaper bandwidth and RTT settings.

       besteffort
            Disables priority queuing by placing all traffic in one tin.

       precedence
            Enables  legacy interpretation of TOS "Precedence" field.  Use of this preset on the modern Internet is firmly discour‐
       aged.

       diffserv4
            Provides a general-purpose Diffserv implementation with four tins:
                 Bulk (CS1, LE in kernel v5.9+), 6.25% threshold, generally low priority.
                 Best Effort (general), 100% threshold.
                 Video (AF4x, AF3x, CS3, AF2x, CS2, TOS4, TOS1), 50% threshold.
                 Voice (CS7, CS6, EF, VA, CS5, CS4), 25% threshold.

       diffserv3 (default)
            Provides a simple, general-purpose Diffserv implementation with three tins:
                 Bulk (CS1, LE in kernel v5.9+), 6.25% threshold, generally low priority.
                 Best Effort (general), 100% threshold.
                 Voice (CS7, CS6, EF, VA, TOS4), 25% threshold, reduced Codel interval.

       fwmark MASK
            This options turns on fwmark-based overriding of CAKE's tin selection.  If set, the option  specifies  a  bitmask  that
       will  be  applied  to  the fwmark associated with each packet. If the result of this masking is non-zero, the result will be
       right-shifted by the number of least-significant unset bits in the mask value, and the result will be used as a the tin num‐
       ber  for  that  packet.  This can be used to set policies in a firewall script that will override CAKE's built-in tin selec‐
       tion.

OTHER PARAMETERS
       memlimit LIMIT
            Limit the memory consumed by Cake to LIMIT bytes. Note that this does not translate directly to queue size (so  do  not
       size this based on bandwidth delay product considerations, but rather on worst case acceptable memory consumption), as there
       is some overhead in the data structures containing the packets, especially for small packets.

            By default, the limit is calculated based on the bandwidth and RTT settings.

       wash

            Traffic entering your diffserv domain is frequently mis-marked in transit from the perspective  of  your  network,  and
       traffic exiting yours may be mis-marked from the perspective of the transiting provider.

       Apply the wash option to clear all extra diffserv (but not ECN bits), after priority queuing has taken place.

       If  you  are shaping inbound, and cannot trust the diffserv markings (as is the case for Comcast Cable, among others), it is
       best to use a single queue "besteffort" mode with wash.

       split-gso

            This option controls whether CAKE will split General Segmentation Offload (GSO) super-packets  into  their  on-the-wire
       components and dequeue them individually.

       Super-packets  are created by the networking stack to improve efficiency.  However, because they are larger they take longer
       to dequeue, which translates to higher latency for competing flows, especially at lower bandwidths. CAKE defaults to  split‐
       ting GSO packets to achieve the lowest possible latency. At link speeds higher than 10 Gbps, setting the no-split-gso param‐
       eter can increase the maximum achievable throughput by retaining the full GSO packets.

OVERRIDING CLASSIFICATION WITH TC FILTERS
       CAKE supports overriding of its internal classification of packets through the tc filter mechanism. Packets can be  assigned
       to  different  priority tins by setting the priority field on the skb, and the flow hashing can be overridden by setting the
       classid parameter.

       Tin override

               To assign a priority tin, the major number of the priority field needs to match the qdisc handle  of  the  cake  in‐
       stance;  if  it  does,  the  minor number will be interpreted as the tin index. For example, to classify all ICMP packets as
       'bulk', the following filter can be used:

               # tc qdisc replace dev eth0 handle 1: root cake diffserv3
               # tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 1 \
                 u32 match icmp type 0 0 action skbedit priority 1:1

       Flow hash override

               To override flow hashing, the classid can be set. CAKE will interpret the major number of the classid  as  the  host
       hash  used  in host isolation mode, and the minor number as the flow hash used for flow-based queueing. One or both of those
       can be set, and will be used if the relevant flow isolation parameter is set (i.e., the major number will be ignored if CAKE
       is not configured in hosts mode, and the minor number will be ignored if CAKE is not configured in flows mode).

       This example will assign all ICMP packets to the first queue:

               # tc qdisc replace dev eth0 handle 1: root cake
               # tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: protocol ip prio 1 \
                 u32 match icmp type 0 0 classid 0:1

       If  only  one  of the host and flow overrides is set, CAKE will compute the other hash from the packet as normal. Note, how‐
       ever, that the host isolation mode works by assigning a host ID to the flow queue; so if overriding both host and flow,  the
       same  flow  cannot have more than one host assigned. In addition, it is not possible to assign different source and destina‐
       tion host IDs through the override mechanism; if a host ID is assigned, it will be used as both source and destination host.
