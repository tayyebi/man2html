<pre>getcpu(2)                                               System Calls Manual                                               getcpu(2)

NAME
       getcpu - determine CPU and NUMA node on which the calling thread is running

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include &lt;sched.h&gt;

       int getcpu(unsigned int *_Nullable cpu, unsigned int *_Nullable node);

DESCRIPTION
       The  getcpu()  system call identifies the processor and node on which the calling thread or process is currently running and
       writes them into the integers pointed to by the cpu and node arguments.  The processor is a unique small integer identifying
       a  CPU.   The node is a unique small identifier identifying a NUMA node.  When either cpu or node is NULL nothing is written
       to the respective pointer.

       The information placed in cpu is guaranteed to be current only at the time of the call: unless the  CPU  affinity  has  been
       fixed  using  sched_setaffinity(2), the kernel might change the CPU at any time.  (Normally this does not happen because the
       scheduler tries to minimize movements between CPUs to keep caches hot, but it is possible.)  The caller must allow  for  the
       possibility that the information returned in cpu and node is no longer current by the time the call returns.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, 0 is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT Arguments point outside the calling process's address space.

VERSIONS
       getcpu() was added in Linux 2.6.19 for x86-64 and i386.  Library support was added in glibc 2.29 (Earlier glibc versions did
       not provide a wrapper for this system call, necessitating the use of syscall(2).)

STANDARDS
       getcpu() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Linux makes a best effort to make this call as fast as possible.  (On some architectures, this is done via an implementation
       in  the  vdso(7).)  The intention of getcpu() is to allow programs to make optimizations with per-CPU data or for NUMA opti‐
       mization.

   C library/kernel differences
       The kernel system call has a third argument:

           int getcpu(unsigned int *cpu, unsigned int *node,
                      struct getcpu_cache *tcache);

       The tcache argument is unused since Linux 2.6.24, and (when invoking the system call directly) should be specified as  NULL,
       unless portability to Linux 2.6.23 or earlier is required.

       In  Linux  2.6.23 and earlier, if the tcache argument was non-NULL, then it specified a pointer to a caller-allocated buffer
       in thread-local storage that was used to provide a caching mechanism for getcpu().  Use of the cache  could  speed  getcpu()
       calls, at the cost that there was a very small chance that the returned information would be out of date.  The caching mech‐
       anism was considered to cause problems when migrating threads between CPUs, and so the argument is now ignored.
