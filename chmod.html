NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode,
       which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit  pattern  for  the
       new mode bits.

       The  format  of  a  symbolic  mode is [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set
       rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.

       A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u),  other
       users  in  the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users (a).  If none of these are given, the
       effect is as if (a) were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

       The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them  to
       be  removed;  and  = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned
       set user and group ID bits are not affected.

       The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or  search  for  directories)
       (x),  execute/search  only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group
       ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you  can  specify
       exactly  one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u), the permissions granted to other
       users who are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding
       categories (o).

       A  numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted dig‐
       its are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted  dele‐
       tion  or  sticky  (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2),
       and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for
       other users not in the file's group, with the same values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a
       problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line,
       chmod  changes  the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recur‐
       sive directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group  ID  or
       one  of  the  user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause
       the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and functionality
       of the underlying chmod system call.  When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior.

       For  directories  chmod preserves set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or
       clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s.  To clear these bits for directories with a numeric  mode  requires  an
       additional leading zero like 00755, leading minus like -6000, or leading equals like =755.

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories,
       it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the  directory;
       this  is  called  the  restricted  deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like
       /tmp.  For regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so  it  will  load
       more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
