<pre>hdparm.conf(5)                                       hdparm configuration file                                       hdparm.conf(5)

NAME
       hdparm.conf - Debian configuration file for hdparm

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  default  configuration  for  hdparm for Debian.  It is a rather simple script, so please follow the following
       guidelines :) Any line that begins with a comment is ignored - add as many as you like.

       Since hdparm doesn't use init script anymore, this configuration is mainly used by udev.  Still one  can  re-apply  settings
       from the config file by calling either

       /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/95hdparm-apm resume

       or by calling

       DEVNAME=/dev/&lt;disk&gt; /lib/udev/hdparm

       Note  that  an  in-line comment is not supported.  If a line consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces, carriage return), it
       will be ignored, so you can space control fields as you like.  ANYTHING ELSE IS PARSED!!

       This means that lines with stray characters or lines  that  use  non  #  comment  characters  will  be  interpreted  by  the
       initscript.   This  has  probably  minor,  but  potentially serious, side effects for your hard drives, so please follow the
       guidelines.  Patches to improve flexibilty welcome.

       Note that if the init script causes boot problems, you can pass 'nohdparm' on the kernel command line, and the  script  will
       not be run.

       Setting an option outside of one of the stanzas enables it for all drives.

       If an option is listed twice, the second instance replaces the first.

       /sbin/hdparm is not run unless a block of the form:

       DEV {

       option

       option

       }

       exists.   This blocks will cause /sbin/hdparm OPTIONS DEV to be run.  Where OPTIONS is the concatenation of all options pre‚Äê
       viously defined outside of a block and all options defined with in the block.

OPTIONS
       See man 8 hdparm
