<pre>arch_prctl(2)                                           System Calls Manual                                           arch_prctl(2)

NAME
       arch_prctl - set architecture-specific thread state

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;asm/prctl.h&gt;        /* Definition of ARCH_* constants */
       #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;      /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int syscall(SYS_arch_prctl, int code, unsigned long addr);
       int syscall(SYS_arch_prctl, int code, unsigned long *addr);

       Note: glibc provides no wrapper for arch_prctl(), necessitating the use of syscall(2).

DESCRIPTION
       arch_prctl() sets architecture-specific process or thread state.  code selects a subfunction and passes argument addr to it;
       addr is interpreted as either an unsigned long for the "set" operations, or as an unsigned long *, for the "get" operations.

       Subfunctions for both x86 and x86-64 are:

       ARCH_SET_CPUID (since Linux 4.12)
              Enable (addr != 0) or disable (addr == 0) the cpuid instruction for the calling thread.  The instruction  is  enabled
              by  default.  If disabled, any execution of a cpuid instruction will instead generate a SIGSEGV signal.  This feature
              can be used to emulate cpuid results that differ from what the underlying hardware would have produced  (e.g.,  in  a
              paravirtualization setting).

              The ARCH_SET_CPUID setting is preserved across fork(2) and clone(2) but reset to the default (i.e., cpuid enabled) on
              execve(2).

       ARCH_GET_CPUID (since Linux 4.12)
              Return the setting of the flag manipulated by ARCH_SET_CPUID as the result of the system call (1 for enabled,  0  for
              disabled).  addr is ignored.

       Subfunctions for x86-64 only are:

       ARCH_SET_FS
              Set the 64-bit base for the FS register to addr.

       ARCH_GET_FS
              Return the 64-bit base value for the FS register of the calling thread in the unsigned long pointed to by addr.

       ARCH_SET_GS
              Set the 64-bit base for the GS register to addr.

       ARCH_GET_GS
              Return the 64-bit base value for the GS register of the calling thread in the unsigned long pointed to by addr.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, arch_prctl() returns 0; on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT addr points to an unmapped address or is outside the process address space.

       EINVAL code is not a valid subcommand.

       ENODEV ARCH_SET_CPUID was requested, but the underlying hardware does not support CPUID faulting.

       EPERM  addr is outside the process address space.

STANDARDS
       arch_prctl() is a Linux/x86-64 extension and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.

NOTES
       arch_prctl() is supported only on Linux/x86-64 for 64-bit programs currently.

       The 64-bit base changes when a new 32-bit segment selector is loaded.

       ARCH_SET_GS is disabled in some kernels.

       Context  switches  for 64-bit segment bases are rather expensive.  As an optimization, if a 32-bit TLS base address is used,
       arch_prctl() may use a real TLS entry as if set_thread_area(2) had been called, instead of  manipulating  the  segment  base
       register directly.  Memory in the first 2 GB of address space can be allocated by using mmap(2) with the MAP_32BIT flag.

       Because  of  the  aforementioned optimization, using arch_prctl() and set_thread_area(2) in the same thread is dangerous, as
       they may overwrite each other's TLS entries.

       FS may be already used by the threading library.  Programs that use ARCH_SET_FS directly are very likely to crash.
