<pre>get_kernel_syms(2)                                      System Calls Manual                                      get_kernel_syms(2)

NAME
       get_kernel_syms - retrieve exported kernel and module symbols

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;

       [[deprecated]] int get_kernel_syms(struct kernel_sym *table);

DESCRIPTION
       Note: This system call is present only before Linux 2.6.

       If  table  is  NULL, get_kernel_syms() returns the number of symbols available for query.  Otherwise, it fills in a table of
       structures:

           struct kernel_sym {
               unsigned long value;
               char          name[60];
           };

       The symbols are interspersed with magic symbols of the form #module-name with the kernel having an empty  name.   The  value
       associated with a symbol of this form is the address at which the module is loaded.

       The symbols exported from each module follow their magic module tag and the modules are returned in the reverse of the order
       in which they were loaded.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns the number of symbols copied to table.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       There is only one possible error return:

       ENOSYS get_kernel_syms() is not supported in this version of the kernel.

VERSIONS
       This system call is present only up until Linux 2.4; it was removed in Linux 2.6.

STANDARDS
       get_kernel_syms() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       This obsolete system call is not supported by glibc.  No declaration is provided in glibc headers, but, through a  quirk  of
       history, glibc versions before glibc 2.23 did export an ABI for this system call.  Therefore, in order to employ this system
       call, it was sufficient to manually declare the interface in your code; alternatively, you could invoke the system call  us‐
       ing syscall(2).

BUGS
       There  is no way to indicate the size of the buffer allocated for table.  If symbols have been added to the kernel since the
       program queried for the symbol table size, memory will be corrupted.

       The length of exported symbol names is limited to 59 characters.

       Because of these limitations, this system call is deprecated in favor of query_module(2) (which is  itself  nowadays  depre‐
       cated in favor of other interfaces described on its manual page).
