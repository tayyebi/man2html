<pre>close_range(2)                                          System Calls Manual                                          close_range(2)

NAME
       close_range - close all file descriptors in a given range

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/close_range.h&gt;

       int close_range(unsigned int first, unsigned int last,
                       unsigned int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The close_range() system call closes all open file descriptors from first to last (included).

       Errors closing a given file descriptor are currently ignored.

       flags is a bit mask containing 0 or more of the following:

       CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC (since Linux 5.11)
              Set the close-on-exec flag on the specified file descriptors, rather than immediately closing them.

       CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE
              Unshare  the  specified  file  descriptors  from  any  other processes before closing them, avoiding races with other
              threads sharing the file descriptor table.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, close_range() returns 0.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL flags is not valid, or first is greater than last.

       The following can occur with CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE (when constructing the new descriptor table):

       EMFILE The number of open file descriptors exceeds the limit specified in /proc/sys/fs/nr_open (see  proc(5)).   This  error
              can  occur  in  situations  where that limit was lowered before a call to close_range() where the CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE
              flag is specified.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

VERSIONS
       close_range() first appeared in Linux 5.9.  Library support was added in glibc 2.34.

STANDARDS
       close_range() is a nonstandard function that is also present on FreeBSD.

NOTES
   Closing all open file descriptors
       To avoid blindly closing file descriptors in the range of possible file  descriptors,  this  is  sometimes  implemented  (on
       Linux)  by listing open file descriptors in /proc/self/fd/ and calling close(2) on each one.  close_range() can take care of
       this without requiring /proc and within a single system call, which provides significant performance benefits.

   Closing file descriptors before exec
       File descriptors can be closed safely using

           /* we don't want anything past stderr here */
           close_range(3, ~0U, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE);
           execve(....);

       CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE is conceptually equivalent to

           unshare(CLONE_FILES);
           close_range(first, last, 0);

       but can be more efficient: if the unshared range extends past the current maximum number of file  descriptors  allocated  in
       the  caller's  file descriptor table (the common case when last is ~0U), the kernel will unshare a new file descriptor table
       for the caller up to first, copying as few file descriptors as possible.  This avoids subsequent  close(2)  calls  entirely;
       the whole operation is complete once the table is unshared.

   Closing files on exec
       This  is  particularly  useful  in cases where multiple pre-exec setup steps risk conflicting with each other.  For example,
       setting up a seccomp(2) profile can conflict with a close_range() call: if the file descriptors are closed before  the  sec‐
       comp(2)  profile  is  set up, the profile setup can't use them itself, or control their closure; if the file descriptors are
       closed afterwards, the seccomp profile can't block the close_range()  call  or  any  fallbacks.   Using  CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC
       avoids  this:  the  descriptors can be marked before the seccomp(2) profile is set up, and the profile can control access to
       close_range() without affecting the calling process.

EXAMPLES
       The program shown below opens the files named in its command-line arguments, displays the list of files that it  has  opened
       (by  iterating  through the entries in /proc/PID/fd), uses close_range() to close all file descriptors greater than or equal
       to 3, and then once more displays the process's list of open files.  The following example demonstrates the use of the  pro‐
       gram:

           $ touch /tmp/a /tmp/b /tmp/c
           $ ./a.out /tmp/a /tmp/b /tmp/c
           /tmp/a opened as FD 3
           /tmp/b opened as FD 4
           /tmp/c opened as FD 5
           /proc/self/fd/0 ==&gt; /dev/pts/1
           /proc/self/fd/1 ==&gt; /dev/pts/1
           /proc/self/fd/2 ==&gt; /dev/pts/1
           /proc/self/fd/3 ==&gt; /tmp/a
           /proc/self/fd/4 ==&gt; /tmp/b
           /proc/self/fd/5 ==&gt; /tmp/b
           /proc/self/fd/6 ==&gt; /proc/9005/fd
           ========= About to call close_range() =======
           /proc/self/fd/0 ==&gt; /dev/pts/1
           /proc/self/fd/1 ==&gt; /dev/pts/1
           /proc/self/fd/2 ==&gt; /dev/pts/1
           /proc/self/fd/3 ==&gt; /proc/9005/fd

       Note that the lines showing the pathname /proc/9005/fd result from the calls to opendir(3).
