NAME

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;          /* See NOTES */
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

DESCRIPTION
       The  domain  argument of the socket(2) specifies a communication domain; this selects the protocol family which will be used
       for communication.  These families are defined in &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;.  The formats currently understood by the Linux kernel  in‐
       clude:
