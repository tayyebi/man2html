NAME
       dumpe2fs - dump ext2/ext3/ext4 file system information

SYNOPSIS
       dumpe2fs [ -bfghixV ] [ -o superblock=superblock ] [ -o blocksize=blocksize ] device

DESCRIPTION
       dumpe2fs prints the super block and blocks group information for the file system present on device.

       Note: When used with a mounted file system, the printed information may be old or inconsistent.

OPTIONS
       -b     print the blocks which are reserved as bad in the file system.

       -o superblock=superblock
              use  the  block superblock when examining the file system.  This option is not usually needed except by a file system
              wizard who is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted file system.

       -o blocksize=blocksize
              use blocks of blocksize bytes when examining the file system.  This option is not usually needed  except  by  a  file
              system wizard who is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted file system.

       -f     force dumpe2fs to display a file system even though it may have some file system feature flags which dumpe2fs may not
              understand (and which can cause some of dumpe2fs's display to be suspect).

       -g     display the group descriptor information in a machine readable colon-separated value format.   The  fields  displayed
              are the group number; the number of the first block in the group; the superblock location (or -1 if not present); the
              range of blocks used by the group descriptors (or -1 if not present); the block bitmap location; the inode bitmap lo‚Äê
              cation; and the range of blocks used by the inode table.

       -h     only display the superblock information and not any of the block group descriptor detail information.

       -i     display the file system data from an image file created by e2image, using device as the pathname to the image file.

       -m     If  the  mmp feature is enabled on the file system, check if device is in use by another node, see e2mmpstatus(8) for
              full details.  If used together with the -i option, only the MMP block information is printed.

       -x     print the detailed group information block numbers in hexadecimal format

       -V     print the version number of dumpe2fs and exit.

EXIT CODE
       dumpe2fs exits with a return code of 0 if the operation completed without errors.  It will exit with a non-zero return  code
       if  there  are any errors, such as problems reading a valid superblock, bad checksums, or if the device is in use by another
       node and -m is specified.

BUGS
       You may need to know the physical file system structure to understand the output.
