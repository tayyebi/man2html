<pre>GIT-CLEAN(1)                                                 Git Manual                                                GIT-CLEAN(1)

NAME
       git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree

SYNOPSIS
       git clean [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e &lt;pattern&gt;] [-x | -X] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]

DESCRIPTION
       Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current
       directory.

       Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the -x option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This
       can, for example, be useful to remove all build products.

       If any optional &lt;pathspec&gt;... arguments are given, only those paths that match the pathspec are affected.

OPTIONS
       -d
           Normally, when no &lt;pathspec&gt; is specified, git clean will not recurse into untracked directories to avoid removing too
           much. Specify -d to have it recurse into such directories as well. If a &lt;pathspec&gt; is specified, -d is irrelevant; all
           untracked files matching the specified paths (with exceptions for nested git directories mentioned under --force) will
           be removed.

       -f, --force
           If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to false, git clean will refuse to delete files or
           directories unless given -f or -i. Git will refuse to modify untracked nested git repositories (directories with a .git
           subdirectory) unless a second -f is given.

       -i, --interactive
           Show what would be done and clean files interactively. See “Interactive mode” for details.

       -n, --dry-run
           Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.

       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are successfully removed.

       -e &lt;pattern&gt;, --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Use the given exclude pattern in addition to the standard ignore rules (see gitignore(5)).

       -x
           Don’t use the standard ignore rules (see gitignore(5)), but still use the ignore rules given with -e options from the
           command line. This allows removing all untracked files, including build products. This can be used (possibly in
           conjunction with git restore or git reset) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean build.

       -X
           Remove only files ignored by Git. This may be useful to rebuild everything from scratch, but keep manually created
           files.

INTERACTIVE MODE
       When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the files and directories to be cleaned, and goes into its
       interactive command loop.

       The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and gives a prompt "What now&gt; ". In general, when the prompt ends
       with a single &gt;, you can pick only one of the choices given and type return, like this:

               *** Commands ***
                   1: clean                2: filter by pattern    3: select by numbers
                   4: ask each             5: quit                 6: help
               What now&gt; 1

       You also could say c or clean above as long as the choice is unique.

       The main command loop has 6 subcommands.

       clean
           Start cleaning files and directories, and then quit.

       filter by pattern
           This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Input ignore patterns&gt;&gt;" prompt. You can input
           space-separated patterns to exclude files and directories from deletion. E.g. "*.c *.h" will excludes files end with
           ".c" and ".h" from deletion. When you are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER (empty) back to the main menu.

       select by numbers
           This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Select items to delete&gt;&gt;" prompt. When the prompt ends
           with double &gt;&gt; like this, you can make more than one selection, concatenated with whitespace or comma. Also you can say
           ranges. E.g. "2-5 7,9" to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list. If the second number in a range is omitted, all remaining
           items are selected. E.g. "7-" to choose 7,8,9 from the list. You can say * to choose everything. Also when you are
           satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER (empty) back to the main menu.

       ask each
           This will start to clean, and you must confirm one by one in order to delete items. Please note that this action is not
           as efficient as the above two actions.

       quit
           This lets you quit without do cleaning.

       help
           Show brief usage of interactive git-clean.

CONFIGURATION
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the git-config(1) documentation. The content is the
       same as what’s found there:

       clean.requireForce
           A boolean to make git-clean do nothing unless given -f, -i or -n. Defaults to true.
