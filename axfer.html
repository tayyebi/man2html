<pre>AXFER(1)                                              General Commands Manual                                              AXFER(1)

NAME
       axfer  -  command-line  sound  recorder  and player for sound devices and nodes supported by Linux sound subsystem (Advanced
       Linux Sound Architecture, also known as ALSA).

SYNOPSYS
       axfer subcommand direction options

       subcommand = transfer | list | version | help

       direction = capture | playback

       options = ( depends on subcommand )

DESCRIPTION
       The  axfer  is  a  command-line  recorder  and  player  to  transfer  audio  data  frame  between  sound  devices/nodes  and
       files/stdin/stdout.

OPTIONS
   Subcommand
       transfer
              Performs transmission of audio data frame. Its detail is described in axfer-transfer(1) manual.

       list   Dumps lists of available sound devices and nodes. Its detail is described in axfer-list(1) manual.

       version
              Prints version of this application (as the same version as alsa-utils package).

       help   Prints a short message about subcommands for users to enter this application.

   Direction
       capture
              Operates for capture transmission.

       playback
              Operates for playback transmission.

EXIT STATUS
       EXIT_SUCCESS (0) if run time successfully finished, else EXIT_FAILURE (1).

UNIT TEST
       This program has unit tests for internal implementation. Please refer to the manual of axfer-transfer for details.

COMPATIBILITY TO APLAY
       The  axfer  is designed to be compatible to aplay(1) as much as possible. In command line, executions of aplay/arecord files
       under $PATH runs axfer with compatibility mode if filesystem has symbolic link from the aplay/arecord to axfer.

           $ ln -s aplay axfer
           $ ln -s arecord axfer

   A string to which arg[0] points
       When args[0] in run time points to string ended with 'aplay', it has the same meaning of playback direction. When it  points
       to string ended with 'arecord', it has the same meaning of capture direction.

   Options acknowledged as list subcommand
       Options  of  -l , --list-devices , -L , --list-pcms are acknowledged as list subcommand. Without them, the run time performs
       transfer subcommand.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report any bugs to mailing list of ALSA community &lt;alsa-devel@alsa-project.org&gt; where the  development  and  maintenance  is
       primarily done. Bug tracking service of alsa-utils repository on github.com is also available.
