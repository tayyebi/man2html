DESCRIPTION
       All  of  these  interfaces  are  available  on  Linux, and are used for getting and setting the process group ID (PGID) of a
       process.  The preferred, POSIX.1-specified ways of doing this are: getpgrp(void), for retrieving the calling process's PGID;
       and setpgid(), for setting a process's PGID.

       setpgid() sets the PGID of the process specified by pid to pgid.  If pid is zero, then the process ID of the calling process
       is used.  If pgid is zero, then the PGID of the process specified by pid is made the same as its process ID.   If  setpgid()
       is  used  to  move  a  process  from  one process group to another (as is done by some shells when creating pipelines), both
       process groups must be part of the same session (see setsid(2) and credentials(7)).  In this case, the pgid specifies an ex‐
       isting process group to be joined and the session ID of that group must match the session ID of the joining process.

       The POSIX.1 version of getpgrp(), which takes no arguments, returns the PGID of the calling process.

       getpgid()  returns the PGID of the process specified by pid.  If pid is zero, the process ID of the calling process is used.
       (Retrieving the PGID of a process other than the caller is rarely necessary, and the POSIX.1 getpgrp() is preferred for that
       task.)

       The System V-style setpgrp(), which takes no arguments, is equivalent to setpgid(0, 0).

       The BSD-specific setpgrp() call, which takes arguments pid and pgid, is a wrapper function that calls

           setpgid(pid, pgid)

       Since  glibc 2.19, the BSD-specific setpgrp() function is no longer exposed by &lt;unistd.h&gt;; calls should be replaced with the
       setpgid() call shown above.

       The BSD-specific getpgrp() call, which takes a single pid argument, is a wrapper function that calls

           getpgid(pid)

       Since glibc 2.19, the BSD-specific getpgrp() function is no longer exposed by &lt;unistd.h&gt;;  calls  should  be  replaced  with
       calls  to  the  POSIX.1  getpgrp()  which  takes  no  arguments  (if the intent is to obtain the caller's PGID), or with the
       getpgid() call shown above.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, setpgid() and setpgrp() return zero.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

       The POSIX.1 getpgrp() always returns the PGID of the caller.

       getpgid(), and the BSD-specific getpgrp() return a process group on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set  to
       indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES An  attempt  was  made to change the process group ID of one of the children of the calling process and the child had
              already performed an execve(2) (setpgid(), setpgrp()).

       EINVAL pgid is less than 0 (setpgid(), setpgrp()).

       EPERM  An attempt was made to move a process into a process group in a different session, or to change the process group  ID
              of  one  of  the  children  of the calling process and the child was in a different session, or to change the process
              group ID of a session leader (setpgid(), setpgrp()).

       ESRCH  For getpgid(): pid does not match any process.  For setpgid(): pid is not the calling process and not a child of  the
              calling process.

STANDARDS
       setpgid() and the version of getpgrp() with no arguments conform to POSIX.1-2001.

       POSIX.1-2001  also specifies getpgid() and the version of setpgrp() that takes no arguments.  (POSIX.1-2008 marks this setp‐
       grp() specification as obsolete.)

       The version of getpgrp() with one argument and the version of setpgrp() that takes two arguments derive from 4.2BSD, and are
       not specified by POSIX.1.

NOTES
       A child created via fork(2) inherits its parent's process group ID.  The PGID is preserved across an execve(2).

       Each process group is a member of a session and each process is a member of the session of which its process group is a mem‐
       ber.  (See credentials(7).)

       A session can have a controlling terminal.  At any time, one (and only one) of the process groups in the session can be  the
       foreground  process  group  for  the terminal; the remaining process groups are in the background.  If a signal is generated
       from the terminal (e.g., typing the interrupt key to generate SIGINT), that signal is sent to the foreground process  group.
       (See  termios(3)  for a description of the characters that generate signals.)  Only the foreground process group may read(2)
       from the terminal; if a background process group tries to read(2) from the terminal, then the group is sent a  SIGTTIN  sig‐
       nal, which suspends it.  The tcgetpgrp(3) and tcsetpgrp(3) functions are used to get/set the foreground process group of the
       controlling terminal.

       The setpgid() and getpgrp() calls are used by programs such as bash(1) to create process groups in order to implement  shell
       job control.

       If  the  termination of a process causes a process group to become orphaned, and if any member of the newly orphaned process
       group is stopped, then a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal will be sent to  each  process  in  the  newly  orphaned
       process  group.  An orphaned process group is one in which the parent of every member of process group is either itself also
       a member of the process group or is a member of a process group in a different session (see also credentials(7)).
