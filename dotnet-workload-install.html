dotnet workload install
       This article applies to: ✔️ .NET 6 SDK and later versions

NAME
       dotnet-workload-install - Installs optional workloads.

SYNOPSIS
              dotnet workload install &lt;WORKLOAD_ID&gt;...
                  [--configfile &lt;FILE&gt;] [--disable-parallel]
                  [--ignore-failed-sources] [--include-previews] [--interactive]
                  [--no-cache] [--skip-manifest-update]
                  [--source &lt;SOURCE&gt;] [--temp-dir &lt;PATH&gt;] [-v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;]

              dotnet workload install -?|-h|--help

DESCRIPTION
       The  dotnet workload install command installs one or more optional workloads.  Optional workloads can be installed on top of
       the .NET SDK to provide support for various application types, such as .NET MAUI and  Blazor  WebAssembly  AOT  (https://de‐
       vblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-4/#blazor-webassembly-ahead-of-time-aot-compilation).

       Use dotnet workload search to learn what workloads are available to install.

   When to run elevated
       For  macOS  and  Linux SDK installations that are installed to a protected directory, the command needs to run elevated (use
       the sudo command).  On Windows, the command doesn’t need to run elevated even if the SDK is installed to the  Program  Files
       directory.  For Windows, the command uses MSI installers for that location.

   Results vary by SDK version
       The  dotnet  workload  commands operate in the context of specific SDK versions.  Suppose you have both .NET 6.0.100 SDK and
       .NET 6.0.200 SDK installed.  The dotnet workload commands will give different results depending on which SDK version you se‐
       lect.  This behavior applies to major and minor version and feature band differences, not to patch version differences.  For
       example, .NET SDK 6.0.101 and 6.0.102 give the same results, whereas 6.0.100 and 6.0.200 give different  results.   You  can
       specify the SDK version by using the global.json file or the --sdk-version option of the dotnet workload commands.

   Advertising manifests
       The  names  and  versions  of the assets that a workload installation requires are maintained in manifests.  By default, the
       dotnet workload install command downloads the latest available manifests before it installs a workload.  The local copy of a
       manifest then provides the information needed to find and download the assets for a workload.

       The  dotnet  workload list command compares the versions of installed workloads with the currently available versions.  When
       it finds that a version newer than the installed version is available, it advertises that fact in the command output.  These
       newer-version notifications in dotnet workload list are available starting in .NET 6.

       To enable these notifications, the latest available versions of the manifests are downloaded and stored as advertising mani‐
       fests.  These downloads happen asynchronously in the background when any of the following commands are run.

       • dotnet build

       • dotnet pack

       • dotnet publish

       • dotnet restore

       • dotnet run

       • dotnet test

       If a command finishes before the manifest download finishes, the download is stopped.  The download is tried again the  next
       time one of these commands is run.  You can set environment variables to disable these background downloads or control their
       frequency.  By default, they don’t happen more than once a day.

       You can prevent the dotnet workload install command from doing manifest downloads by using  the  --skip-manifest-update  op‐
       tion.

       The  dotnet  workload update command also downloads advertising manifests.  The downloads are required to learn if an update
       is available, so there is no option to prevent them from running.  However, you can use the --advertising-manifests-only op‐
       tion to skip workload updates and only do the manifest downloads.  This option is available starting in .NET 6.

ARGUMENTS
       • WORKLOAD_ID...

         The workload ID or multiple IDs to install.  Use dotnet workload search to learn what workloads are available.

OPTIONS
       • --configfile &lt;FILE&gt;

         The  NuGet configuration file (nuget.config) to use.  If specified, only the settings from this file will be used.  If not
         specified, the hierarchy of configuration files from the current directory will be used.  For more information, see Common
         NuGet Configurations.

       • --disable-parallel

         Prevents restoring multiple projects in parallel.

       • -?|-h|--help

         Prints out a description of how to use the command.

       • --ignore-failed-sources

         Treats package source failures as warnings.

       • --include-previews

         Allows prerelease workload manifests.

       • --interactive

         Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action.  For example, to complete authentication.

       • --no-cache

         Prevents caching of packages and http requests.

       • --skip-manifest-update

         Skip  updating  the  workload  manifests.  The workload manifests define what assets and versions need to be installed for
         each workload.

       • -s|--source &lt;SOURCE&gt;

         Specifies the URI of the NuGet package source to use.  This  setting  overrides  all  of  the  sources  specified  in  the
         nuget.config files.  Multiple sources can be provided by specifying this option multiple times.

       • --temp-dir &lt;PATH&gt;

         Specify the temporary directory used to download and extract NuGet packages (must be secure).

       • -v|--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;

         Sets  the  verbosity level of the command.  Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
         The default is minimal.  If you specify detailed or diagnostic verbosity, the command displays information about the Nuget
         packages that it downloads.

EXAMPLES
       • Install the maui workload:

                dotnet workload install maui

       • Install the maui-android and maui-ios workloads:

                dotnet workload install maui-android maui-ios

                                                             2022-10-10                                  dotnet-workload-install(1)
