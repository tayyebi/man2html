<pre>BIO(7SSL)                                                     OpenSSL                                                     BIO(7SSL)

NAME
       bio - Basic I/O abstraction

SYNOPSIS
        #include &lt;openssl/bio.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION
       A BIO is an I/O abstraction, it hides many of the underlying I/O details from an application. If an application uses a BIO
       for its I/O it can transparently handle SSL connections, unencrypted network connections and file I/O.

       There are two types of BIO, a source/sink BIO and a filter BIO.

       As its name implies a source/sink BIO is a source and/or sink of data, examples include a socket BIO and a file BIO.

       A filter BIO takes data from one BIO and passes it through to another, or the application. The data may be left unmodified
       (for example a message digest BIO) or translated (for example an encryption BIO). The effect of a filter BIO may change
       according to the I/O operation it is performing: for example an encryption BIO will encrypt data if it is being written to
       and decrypt data if it is being read from.

       BIOs can be joined together to form a chain (a single BIO is a chain with one component). A chain normally consists of one
       source/sink BIO and one or more filter BIOs. Data read from or written to the first BIO then traverses the chain to the end
       (normally a source/sink BIO).

       Some BIOs (such as memory BIOs) can be used immediately after calling BIO_new(). Others (such as file BIOs) need some
       additional initialization, and frequently a utility function exists to create and initialize such BIOs.

       If BIO_free() is called on a BIO chain it will only free one BIO resulting in a memory leak.

       Calling BIO_free_all() on a single BIO has the same effect as calling BIO_free() on it other than the discarded return
       value.

       Normally the type argument is supplied by a function which returns a pointer to a BIO_METHOD. There is a naming convention
       for such functions: a source/sink BIO typically starts with BIO_s_ and a filter BIO with BIO_f_.

EXAMPLES
       Create a memory BIO:

        BIO *mem = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
