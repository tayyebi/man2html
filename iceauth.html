NAME
       iceauth - ICE authority file utility

SYNOPSIS
       iceauth [ -f authfile ] [ -vqibuV ] [ command arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  iceauth program is used to edit and display the authorization information used in connecting with ICE.  This program is
       usually used to extract authorization records from one machine and merge them in on another (as is the case when  using  re‐
       mote  logins  or  granting  access to other users).  Commands (described below) may be entered interactively, on the iceauth
       command line, or in scripts.

OPTIONS
       -f authfile  Name of the authority file to use. Will default to
                    the file currently in use by the session.

       -v           Turns on extra messages (verbose mode)

       -q           Turns off extra messages (quiet mode)

       -i           Ignore the locks on the authority file

       -b           Break the locks on the authority file

       -u           Print basic usage instructions

       -V           Print version and exit
