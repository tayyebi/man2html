<pre>GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)                                            Git Manual                                           GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)

NAME
       git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed archive

SYNOPSIS
       git index-pack [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;] [--[no-]rev-index] &lt;pack-file&gt;
       git index-pack --stdin [--fix-thin] [--keep] [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;]
                         [--[no-]rev-index] [&lt;pack-file&gt;]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and builds a pack index file (.idx) for it. Optionally writes a
       reverse-index (.rev) for the specified pack. The packed archive together with the pack index can then be placed in the
       objects/pack/ directory of a Git repository.

OPTIONS
       -v
           Be verbose about what is going on, including progress status.

       -o &lt;index-file&gt;
           Write the generated pack index into the specified file. Without this option the name of pack index file is constructed
           from the name of packed archive file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the program fails if the name of packed archive
           does not end with .pack).

       --[no-]rev-index
           When this flag is provided, generate a reverse index (a .rev file) corresponding to the given pack. If --verify is
           given, ensure that the existing reverse index is correct. Takes precedence over pack.writeReverseIndex.

       --stdin
           When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin instead and a copy is then written to &lt;pack-file&gt;. If
           &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified, the pack is written to objects/pack/ directory of the current Git repository with a
           default name determined from the pack content. If &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified consider using --keep to prevent a race
           condition between this process and git repack.

       --fix-thin
           Fix a "thin" pack produced by git pack-objects --thin (see git-pack-objects(1) for details) by adding the excluded
           objects the deltified objects are based on to the pack. This option only makes sense in conjunction with --stdin.

       --keep
           Before moving the index into its final destination create an empty .keep file for the associated pack file. This option
           is usually necessary with --stdin to prevent a simultaneous git repack process from deleting the newly constructed pack
           and index before refs can be updated to use objects contained in the pack.

       --keep=&lt;msg&gt;
           Like --keep create a .keep file before moving the index into its final destination, but rather than creating an empty
           file place &lt;msg&gt; followed by an LF into the .keep file. The &lt;msg&gt; message can later be searched for within all .keep
           files to locate any which have outlived their usefulness.

       --index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]
           This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It allows to force the version for the generated pack index, and to
           force 64-bit index entries on objects located above the given offset.

       --strict
           Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links.

       --progress-title
           For internal use only.

           Set the title of the progress bar. The title is "Receiving objects" by default and "Indexing objects" when --stdin is
           specified.

       --check-self-contained-and-connected
           Die if the pack contains broken links. For internal use only.

       --fsck-objects
           For internal use only.

           Die if the pack contains broken objects. If the pack contains a tree pointing to a .gitmodules blob that does not exist,
           prints the hash of that blob (for the caller to check) after the hash that goes into the name of the pack/idx file (see
           "Notes").

       --threads=&lt;n&gt;
           Specifies the number of threads to spawn when resolving deltas. This requires that index-pack be compiled with pthreads
           otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The
           required amount of memory for the delta search window is however multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying 0 will
           cause Git to auto-detect the number of CPUâ€™s and use maximum 3 threads.

       --max-input-size=&lt;size&gt;
           Die, if the pack is larger than &lt;size&gt;.

       --object-format=&lt;hash-algorithm&gt;
           Specify the given object format (hash algorithm) for the pack. The valid values are sha1 and (if enabled) sha256. The
           default is the algorithm for the current repository (set by extensions.objectFormat), or sha1 if no value is set or
           outside a repository.

           This option cannot be used with --stdin.

           THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL! SHA-256 support is experimental and still in an early stage. A SHA-256 repository will in
           general not be able to share work with "regular" SHA-1 repositories. It should be assumed that, e.g., Git internal file
           formats in relation to SHA-256 repositories may change in backwards-incompatible ways. Only use --object-format=sha256
           for testing purposes.

       --promisor[=&lt;message&gt;]
           Before committing the pack-index, create a .promisor file for this pack. Particularly helpful when writing a promisor
           pack with --fix-thin since the name of the pack is not final until the pack has been fully written. If a &lt;message&gt; is
           provided, then that content will be written to the .promisor file for future reference. See partial clone[1] for more
           information.

NOTES
       Once the index has been created, the hash that goes into the name of the pack/idx file is printed to stdout. If --stdin was
       also used then this is prefixed by either "pack\t", or "keep\t" if a new .keep file was successfully created. This is useful
       to remove a .keep file used as a lock to prevent the race with git repack mentioned above.
