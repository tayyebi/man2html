<pre>DELUSER(8)                                            System Manager's Manual                                            DELUSER(8)

NAME
       deluser, delgroup - remove a user or group from the system

SYNOPSIS
       deluser [[options]] [--no-preserve-root] [--remove-home] [--remove-all-files] [--backup] [--backup-to dir] [user]
       deluser [--group] [[options]] [group]
       delgroup [[options]] [--only-if-empty] [group]
       deluser [[options]] [user] [group]

DESCRIPTION
       deluser and delgroup remove users and groups from the system according to command line options and configuration information
       in /etc/deluser.conf and /etc/adduser.conf.  They are friendlier front ends to the userdel and groupdel  programs,  removing
       the  home  directory as option or even all files on the system owned by the user to be removed, running a custom script, and
       other features.  deluser and delgroup can be run in one of three modes:

   Remove a normal user
       If called with one non-option argument and without the --group option, deluser will remove a normal user.

       By default, deluser will remove the user without removing the home directory, the mail spool  or any other files on the sys‐
       tem owned by the user.  Removing the home directory and mail spool can be achieved using the --remove-home option.

       The   --remove-all-files  option  removes all files on the system owned by the user.  Note that if you activate both options
       --remove-home will have no effect because all files including the home directory and mail spool are already covered  by  the
       --remove-all-files option.

       If  you  want  to  backup all files before deleting them you can activate the --backup option which will create a file user‐
       name.tar(.gz|.bz2) in the directory specified by the --backup-to option (defaulting to the current working directory).

         By default, the backup archive is compressed with gzip. To change this, the --backup-suffix option can be set to any  suf‐
       fix supported by tar --auto-compress (e.g. .gz, .bz2, .xz).

       The  remove,  suffix,  and  backup  options can also be activated by default in the configuration file etc/deluser.conf. See
       deluser.conf(5) for details.

       If you want to remove the root account (uid 0), then use the --no-preserve-root parameter; this may prevent  to  remove  the
       root user by accident.

       If the file /usr/local/sbin/deluser.local exists, it will be executed after the user account has been removed in order to do
       any local cleanup.  The arguments passed to deluser.local are:
       username uid gid home-directory

   Remove a group
       If deluser is called with the --group  option, or delgroup is called, a group will be removed.

       Warning: The primary group of an existing user cannot be removed.

       If the option --only-if-empty is given, the group won't be removed if it has any members left.

   Remove a user from a specific group
       If called with two non-option arguments, deluser will remove a user from a specific group.

OPTIONS
       --conf file,-c file
              Use file instead of the default files /etc/deluser.conf and /etc/adduser.conf.

       --group
              Remove a group. This is the default action if the program is invoked as delgroup.

       --help, -h
              Display brief instructions.

       --quiet, -q
              Suppress progress messages.

       --debug
              Be verbose, most useful if you want to nail down a problem.

       --system
              Only delete if user/group is a system user/group. This avoids accidentally deleting  non-system  users/groups.  Addi‐
              tionally, if the user does not exist, no error value is returned. Debian package maintainer scripts may use this flag
              to remove system users or groups while ignoring the case where the removal already occurred.

       --only-if-empty
              Only remove if no members are left.

       --backup
              Backup all files contained in the userhome and  the  mailspool  file  to  a  file  named  username.tar.bz2  or  user‐
              name.tar.gz.

       --backup-to dir
              Place the backup files not in the current directory but in dir.  This implicitly sets --backup also.

       --remove-home
              Remove  the home directory of the user and its mailspool.  If --backup is specified, the files are deleted after hav‐
              ing performed the backup.

       --remove-all-files
              Remove all files from the system owned by this user.  Note: --remove-home does not  have  an  effect  any  more.   If
              --backup is specified, the files are deleted after having performed the backup.

       --version
              Display version and copyright information.

RETURN VALUE
       0      Success: The action was successfully executed.

       1      The user to delete was not a system account.  No action was performed.

       2      There is no such user.  No action was performed.

       3      There is no such group.  No action was performed.

       4      Internal error.  No action was performed.

       5      The group to delete is not empty.  No action was performed.

       6      The user does not belong to the specified group.  No action was performed.

       7      You cannot remove a user from its primary group.  No action was performed.

       8      The required perl 'perl' is not installed.  This package is required to perform the requested actions.  No action was
              performed.

       9      For removing the root account the parameter --no-preserve-root is required.  No action was performed.

SECURITY
       deluser needs root privileges and offers, via the --conf command line option to use a different configuration file.  Do  not
       use  sudo  or  similar  tools to give partial privileges to deluser with restricted command line parameters. This is easy to
       circumvent and might allow users to create arbitrary accounts. If you want this, consider writing your  own  wrapper  script
       and giving privileges to execute that script.

FILES
       /etc/deluser.conf Default configuration file for deluser and delgroup

       /usr/local/sbin/deluser.local
              Optional custom add-ons.
