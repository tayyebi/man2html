NAME
       e2image - Save critical ext2/ext3/ext4 file system metadata to a file

SYNOPSIS
       e2image [-r|-Q [-af]] [ -b superblock ] [ -B blocksize ] [ -cnps ] [ -o src_offset ] [ -O dest_offset ] device image-file
       e2image -I device image-file

DESCRIPTION
       The e2image program will save critical ext2, ext3, or ext4 file system metadata located on device to a file specified by im‐
       age-file.  The image file may be examined by dumpe2fs and debugfs, by using the -i option to those programs.  This  can  as‐
       sist an expert in recovering catastrophically corrupted file systems.

       It  is  a  very good idea to create image files for all file systems on a system and save the partition layout (which can be
       generated using the fdisk -l command) at regular intervals --- at boot time, and/or every week or so.  The image file should
       be  stored  on some file system other than the file system whose data it contains, to ensure that this data is accessible in
       the case where the file system has been badly damaged.

       To save disk space, e2image creates the image file as a sparse file, or in QCOW2 format.  Hence, if the  sparse  image  file
       needs  to  be copied to another location, it should either be compressed first or copied using the --sparse=always option to
       the GNU version of cp(1).  This does not apply to the QCOW2 image, which is not sparse.

       The size of an ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of the file systems and how many inodes are in use.  For a typ‐
       ical  10 Gigabyte file system, with 200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2 million inodes, the image file will be approximately 35
       Megabytes; a 4 Gigabyte file system with 15,000 inodes in use out of 550,000 inodes will result in a 3 Megabyte image  file.
       Image  files  tend  to  be quite compressible; an image file taking up 32 Megabytes of space on disk will generally compress
       down to 3 or 4 Megabytes.

       If image-file is -, then the output of e2image will be sent to standard output, so that the output can be piped  to  another
       program,  such  as gzip(1).  (Note that this is currently only supported when creating a raw image file using the -r option,
       since the process of creating a normal image file, or QCOW2 image currently requires random access to the file, which cannot
       be done using a pipe.

OPTIONS
       -a     Include file data in the image file.  Normally e2image only includes fs metadata, not regular file data.  This option
              will produce an image that is suitable to use to clone the entire FS or for backup purposes.  Note that  this  option
              only  works  with  the raw (-r) or QCOW2 (-Q) formats.  In conjunction with the -r option it is possible to clone all
              and only the used blocks of one file system to another device/image file.

       -b superblock
              Get image from partition with broken primary superblock by using the superblock located at file system  block  number
              superblock.  The partition is copied as-is including broken primary superblock.

       -B blocksize
              Set  the file system blocksize in bytes.  Normally, e2image will search for the superblock at various different block
              sizes in an attempt to find the appropriate blocksize. This search can be fooled in some cases.  This  option  forces
              e2fsck  to only try locating the superblock with a particular blocksize. If the superblock is not found, e2image will
              terminate with a fatal error.

       -c     Compare each block to be copied from the source device to the corresponding block in the target image-file.  If  both
              are  already the same, the write will be skipped.  This is useful if the file system is being cloned to a flash-based
              storage device (where reads are very fast and where it is desirable to avoid unnecessary writes to reduce write  wear
              on the device).

       -f     Override the read-only requirement for the source file system when saving the image file using the -r and -Q options.
              Normally, if the source file system is in use, the resulting image file is very likely not going  to  be  useful.  In
              some cases where the source file system is in constant use this may be better than no image at all.

       -I     install the metadata stored in the image file back to the device.  It can be used to restore the file system metadata
              back to the device in emergency situations.

       WARNING!!!!  The -I option should only be used as a desperation measure when other alternatives have failed.   If  the  file
       system  has  changed  since  the  image file was created, data will be lost.  In general, you should make another full image
       backup of the file system first, in case you wish to try other recovery strategies afterward.

       -n     Cause all image writes to be skipped, and instead only print the block numbers that would have been written.

       -o src_offset
              Specify offset of the image to be read from the start of the source device in bytes.  See OFFSETS for more details.

       -O tgt_offset
              Specify offset of the image to be written from the start of the target image-file in bytes.  See OFFSETS for more de‐
              tails.

       -p     Show progress of image-file creation.

       -Q     Create  a  QCOW2-format  image  file  instead of a normal image file, suitable for use by virtual machine images, and
              other tools that can use the .qcow image format. See QCOW2 IMAGE FILES below for details.

       -r     Create a raw image file instead of a normal image file.  See RAW IMAGE FILES below for details.

       -s     Scramble directory entries and zero out unused portions of the directory blocks in the written image  file  to  avoid
              revealing information about the contents of the file system.  However, this will prevent analysis of problems related
              to hash-tree indexed directories.

RAW IMAGE FILES
       The -r option will create a raw image file, which differs from a normal image file in two  ways.   First,  the  file  system
       metadata  is  placed  in  the same relative offset within image-file as it is in the device so that debugfs(8), dumpe2fs(8),
       e2fsck(8), losetup(8), etc. and can be run directly on the raw image file.  In order to minimize the amount  of  disk  space
       consumed  by  the raw image file, it is created as a sparse file.  (Beware of copying or compressing/decompressing this file
       with utilities that don't understand how to create sparse files; the file will become as large as the file  system  itself!)
       Secondly,  the  raw  image  file  also includes indirect blocks and directory blocks, which the standard image file does not
       have.

       Raw image files are sometimes used when sending file systems to the maintainer as part of bug reports  to  e2fsprogs.   When
       used in this capacity, the recommended command is as follows (replace hda1 with the appropriate device for your system):

            e2image -r /dev/hda1 - | bzip2 &gt; hda1.e2i.bz2

       This  will  only send the metadata information, without any data blocks.  However, the filenames in the directory blocks can
       still reveal information about the contents of the file system that the bug reporter may wish to keep confidential.  To  ad‐
       dress this concern, the -s option can be specified to scramble the filenames in the image.

       Note  that  this will work even if you substitute /dev/hda1 for another raw disk image, or QCOW2 image previously created by
       e2image.

QCOW2 IMAGE FILES
       The -Q option will create a QCOW2 image file instead of a normal, or raw image file.  A QCOW2 image contains all the  infor‐
       mation  the raw image does, however unlike the raw image it is not sparse. The QCOW2 image minimize the amount of space used
       by the image by storing it in special format which packs data closely together, hence avoiding holes while still  minimizing
       size.

       In  order  to  send file system to the maintainer as a part of bug report to e2fsprogs, use following commands (replace hda1
       with the appropriate device for your system):

            e2image -Q /dev/hda1 hda1.qcow2
            bzip2 -z hda1.qcow2

       This will only send the metadata information, without any data blocks.  As described for RAW IMAGE FILES the -s  option  can
       be specified to scramble the file system names in the image.

       Note  that  the  QCOW2 image created by e2image is a regular QCOW2 image and can be processed by tools aware of QCOW2 format
       such as for example qemu-img.

       You can convert a .qcow2 image into a raw image with:

            e2image -r hda1.qcow2 hda1.raw

       This can be useful to write a QCOW2 image containing all data to a sparse image file where it can be loop mounted, or  to  a
       disk partition.  Note that this may not work with QCOW2 images not generated by e2image.

OFFSETS
       Normally a file system starts at the beginning of a partition, and e2image is run on the partition.  When working with image
       files, you don't have the option of using the partition device, so you can specify the offset where the file  system  starts
       directly  with  the -o option.  Similarly the -O option specifies the offset that should be seeked to in the destination be‐
       fore writing the file system.

       For example, if you have a dd image of a whole hard drive that contains an ext2 fs in a partition starting at 1 MiB, you can
       clone that image to a block device with:

            e2image -aro 1048576 img /dev/sda1

       Or  you  can clone a file system from a block device into an image file, leaving room in the first MiB for a partition table
       with:

            e2image -arO 1048576 /dev/sda1 img

       If you specify at least one offset, and only one file, an in-place move will be performed, allowing you to safely  move  the
       file system from one offset to another.
